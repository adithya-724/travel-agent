In Phuket, the Amari Phuket or the Hyatt Regency Phuket are great. In Punta Cana, check out the Iberostar Grand Bávaro or the Excellence Punta Cana. Low chance of rain and generally sunny and pleasant temperatures in both places 

Cancun and Jamaica (Negril or Montego Bay) could be great alternatives

Choose Phuket if you want a richer cultural experience and are interested in exploring local life and natural landscapes beyond just the beach. It offers more variety in activities and sightseeing.
Choose Punta Cana if your main goal is a classic beach resort experience where you can relax in luxury without worrying about additional costs

Thailand better, safer ect. I’d never go back to dominican . Hustled and scammed until i was watching my back just to get out of there. Rented a car that was stolen from me. Offered to have a beer at this guys bar. I was nice enough to buy him and his friend a beer then came the extremely high bill. Yeah. Had to deal with police after vehicle was stolen no thanks. I go in vacation for peace not to have my nerve racked. Taxi driver scammed to. Always ask price from point to point . Just cause he gave you a good price on the first trip dont assume. Thailand hand down never had a issue there.  Always have people running up to you trying to get money no peace. If you go stay in a resort. Cause when you go out the coming. If you go better have your antennas working to catch the bs.

    Wow that’s very interesting, I mean people do say to stay in the resort in punta cana but to me that doesn’t seem like a nice experience. I actually want to go out and see the culture. But thank you for posting your experience, I’m sure the resorts in Punta Cana are beautiful but I’m all about experiencing and seeing the culture so I’m very much now looking at holiday packages to Thailand to Koh Samui, it just looks incredible! I think your take just sealed it lol

        Just be careful and keep you antennas on! And, otherwise enjoy your trip. Just for me its a NOPE! Thailand is amazing.  Lots of part of Thailand - its whatever your looking for.Just learn something about the kingdom b4 you go.   I was going to Medellin Colombia  a-lot stop going there too. Some guys getting drugged . But i loved it there

                    Two quick questions actually, now that I’ve had a chance to look at hotels and packages in general, most hotels only offer breakfast so was food on Koh Samui good prices or are they marked up to tourist prices? Do you recommend any food places around there? Thanks!

                        Yeah don’t go for hotel food haha. Local food in Thailand is the best I ever had. Nothing can beat a great Tom Yum  for $1. Are you looking for resorts or what? What part of the island are you looking? Perhaps could find some local spots for you. Just google for best local food in Koh Samui and you definitely will catch the hotspots, e.g.: https://www.eatingthaifood.com/restaurants/thai-food-in-koh-samui/ or https://phanganist.com/koh-samui-travel-guide-eat-drink-restaurant-article/koh-samui-thai-food-guide ofcourse you can go for something higher end like https://fanclubthailand.co.uk/11-of-the-best-places-to-eat-on-ko-samui/

                            We’re both big fans of Thai cuisine so can’t wait to try proper local authentic food, just wanted to make sure we’re catching the right places! Thank you for those links I’ll have a look. I’ve been looking at more of the resorts, there was a TUI Blue and a Sheraton that kept popping up but still indecisive as to the actual hotel location on the island as I’m not sure where the best spots are atm. I will be booking it by the end of this week hopefully. If you have any recommendations on locations please send them over I would be extremely grateful! Thanks!

New Zealand, Australia, Fiji or Papau New Guinea, Maldives. Places in the world that are expensive to get to.

    Reply:1
    I wouldn't put Papua New Guinea on the same list as the others. 

The rest, pretty much anyone would enjoy, or could find something cool to do. PNG is kind of a dump in the urban areas, and the rural areas, while beautiful, are difficult and/or expensive to get to.

    Reply:1
    To add to this, once you pick one of these, you can do multiple quite cheaply. Flights to or from Australia and New Zealand are usually pretty low. You can use Fiji as a layover destination (or Tahiti) if you're flying from North America. If not, Fiji is a 4 hour flight from Auckland. Flights to Bali, Indonesia are cheap if you fly out of many big airports in Australia. Thailand is cheap to get to as well. Vanuatu would likely be memorable and is a less known destination, but it's right in the area. 

New Zealand has incredible nature. They have glow worms. They have a good recognition of the Maori culture that's definitely worth checking out. They have Milford sound. They have some of the clearest night skies in the world on the south island. Australia has the Great Barrier Reef, but it's dying. If you want to see it, there's not going to be a better time. They have a rainforest. Animals you're not going to see in the wild anywhere else. There's also ways to discount travel in these countries as well. Both have an active transfercar network, allowing rental cars in some instances to be rented for almost nothing (I rented one for 2 days in NZ through this website. With full insurance, it was $60 for both days combined). In Queensland, Australia, you can get a rail pass to use the trains going one way or all ways for one or two moths; $300 or $400 depending on the ticket. It comes with unlimited stops. You could see a shit ton of the East Coast and even into the outback if you wanted to for that cost.

Zimbabwe/Zambia - Safari

If you’re looking for a “trip of a lifetime”-tier place, I think Patagonia should be high on your list. It’s a huge region spanning southern Chile and Argentina. Fly into Santiago, take a couple days to check it out (great nightlife scene here), hop down to Bariloche for a few days, and then head down to the main attractions like Torres del Paine, Perito Moreno, and Fitz Roy. If you’re feeling really crazy, head down to Terra del Fuego province and book a boat to take you to Antarctica — because you’ll likely never be closer! 

Chile and Argentina have interesting cultures and some of the most impressive nature I’ve ever seen. The seasons are flipped from ours in the northern hemisphere, so if you live somewhere with nasty winter weather this might be a welcome break. Unique animal life in Patagonia like ñandú (like an emu), penguins, and guanacos (like a llama). Plan to rent a car once you’re down in Patagonia and just have a blast. One of the best trips I’ve ever done.

Southern Spain, Andalusia. Sevilla, and Granada. You'd be hard pressed to spend $7k on flights and hotels though, even the best hotels are like $300/night. The cost of living there is very low but it's the best place in the world to me.

Maybe go to Italy on the $7k budget and save Spain for when you're paying your own way. Italy is wonderful too, but you pay for the nicer accommodations there.

This question had me stumped for a good hour. I too, am a traveler like you (it sounds like we are into similar experiences) so I’ve almost decided to answer this as an “if you liked this adventure.. try this also” so here we go:

If you liked deep sea fishing in Cabo, similar but mind blowing experiences would be taking a private snorkeling (or fishing whichever you prefer) tour in Belize. + 1 you could learn how to dive in the coolest place on earth. If seafood is your thing, Belize has some of the freshest including restaurants. 

Partying with the locals? Sort of in a rubbing elbows, organically happens way? Not a forced Airbnb experience of partying with the locals? Easily Medellin Colombia. Yes Provenza and Poblado are fun and all they’re hyped up to be but, I highly recommend La 70 for a super authentic experience. This is where life happens + 1 if you can go to a Nacional or DME game. The streets around the stadium are full of life and locals. Take a helicopter over the Piedra de Peñol and spend the night  glamping in Guatape. Stroll through the town and learn about silleteros sit in the plaza and take life in. While we are on the topic of Colombia, go ride a Willy in Salento and enjoy all the colorful streets. Take a horse through the coffee fields and have a cup of Joe with your tour guide (hola Don. Luis).  PLAY TEJO. This is where you will party with the locals (and tourists!) doing the most traditional FUN AND I MEAN FUN game in the world. Head over to Cartagena, but discover the streets of Getsemani. Take a boat tour to the Islas of Rosario!!! Look at Jade. Marvel at all of the beauty (and strong character) of Cartagena at night. Bonus adventure: San Andres Island. The water is worth it. Go as bougieeee as you wish with your hotels here or as humble. It’s the right country for both. 

Eat pizza on the Pacaya Volcano with chef David before he becomes way too famous! You can hike or horseback up to the volcano? Slide down a volcano in Leon, then take the party bus back into town. Fun fun experience. Drink and dance at a floating water bar (Bitcoin!) in the middle of the most beautiful blue water on Big Corn Island in Nicaragua. Stay at Yemaya Little Corm if you feel up to it. It gives Maldives on a budget vibes. Still fairly raw and untainted. 

Visit the temples of Bali. 

Chase waterfalls in Iceland and Faroe Islands. I highly recommend getting lost here - rent a car and get off the beaten path. See the northern lights. Go behind water falls at the Faroe Islands. Seek your own smaller waterfalls. 

Go party in the streets of puerto Escondido. 

Puerto Rico, La Plácita de Santurce to party with the locals. Reggaeton blasting from every possible angle. Drinks are good, food is cheap. 

Wake up early and go watch the monks and dogs interact in the temples of Bangkok right before the madness starts and the world roars. Take the water taxi down and absorb all the temples. Stay at the Penninsula, ball on a budget or go all out on luxury. 

Go to Kuala Lumpur and take in all of the sky scrapers and culture. Eat Dim Sum in Hong Kong, then hit a rooftop bar or lounge. Immerse yourself in the culture. 

Walk the Sydney bridge, spoil yourself in Sydney, take selfies with quokka in Perth. Go see the Great Barrier Reef, or don’t. But what an amazing decision to have to make. 

Have fun and keep us posted on what you decide on.

    Damn, thanks a ton for this. 

It's scary and exciting that I haven't heard of the majority of the places you've mentioned. We've been exclusively in Asia and Europe, looking to broaden our horizons and you've given us a great place to start. Thanks, again!

While Colombia is on our places to travel, I think we're deciding on a 2 week excursion in Tanzania. We're in the process of talking to several tour groups to help us through the planning. There's so much to do! We're usually pretty chill about our plans, but we're definitely breaking out the spreadsheets for this one.

Echoing everyone here- give yourself the gift of a luxury safari. For more variety (which you’ll want… safaris are a lot of sitting) look up Tanzania. Some of the best wildlife viewing in the world, Zanzibar for culture/food/diving and Arusha (I haven’t been there, but have heard good reviews for culture experiences as well).

    Reply:1
    I second the Safari - it’s truly the most amazing feeling to see a pride of lions eating a giraffe, the great migration with wildebeest risking croc attacks to cross the water, hippos snorting in the river nearby, and elephants plodding along to the water hole . Africa has the most jaw dropping sunsets and scenery, and a sense of calm in bush that you won’t find elsewhere. It was supposed to be a once in a lifetime trip , and now it’s every year or two we go . So addictive. 

I liked Tanzania , and Kenya, but my favourite is South Africa ( Kruger more than Kalahari ) .

Great honeymoon destination!

I would recommend a mix of adventure destinations and relaxing areas.

Phuket could be a good base, but I'm personally not a huge fan of the area - quite touristy, but the comfort in that might suit!

You could use Phuket as a base (probably where you'll find the best street food, after Bangkok), and depending on how long you have, you could visit:
- Khao Sok national park
- Koh Lanta (very relaxing beachy island)
- Koh Tao (beachy, but more touristy)
If I could only pick one, I'd stay at a nice villa in Koh Tao and alternate between relaxing days at beach bars and slightly more adventurous walks or trips to other beaches.

For cash, check your bank/card fees for ATM and international transactions. Most likely outcome is you'll be best to take out a lot of cash at a good international ATM (they usually let you take the most out). You can do this at the airport when you also get a Sim card.

For the electrical plugs, generally the US plug is accepted. Some places may only have a EU style plug, so perhaps consider bringing a converter. Be sure to check any chargers you bring are rated to 220V, since US is 110V (though most products can handle 110-240V.

Hope this helps!

If you’ve never left the US, Phuket is a great start. Yes, it’s touristy for Thailand, but way less touristy than Cancun. Lots of great hotels and resorts right on the beach, INCREDIBLE food, nice people. Don’t stay in Patong, it’s kinda gross, but good to go there for a night for food market. There are ATM’s all over the place. There’s a cash exchange place in the old town right around the corner from the Sunday night market that has great rates (never change money at the airport). There are a lot of night markets, some have different vibes but generally sell the same stuff. There’s a super fancy designer mall (LV, Gucci, etc) in Phuket if you want something high end. There are so many incredible day trips you can take. If you stay somewhere other than the old town and Patong, it’s not overrun by tourists and you can have a really good time. Enjoy!

Phuket is very touristy. If you wanna go where the locals go, try Hua Hin. If you’re looking to splurge - Naka Island. 

ICONSIAM for shopping, but honestly, there are tons of malls in Bangkok. If you’re looking for clothes, try Platinum Fashion Mall. Chinatown has some great street food, but honestly, just about anywhere is good. 

I just bring cash (get newer $100 bills as Thai banks exchange places won’t accept old ones). You get a better exchange rate exchanging $100s vs $20s. Use a credit card that doesn’t haven’t foreign transaction fees, but be prepared to mostly pay w/ cash if you’re not in malls, hotels, or major food chains. Also use Superrich Money Exchange away from the airport. They generally have the best rates. 

As for phone chargers, they have regular outlets like the US. I had no issues. 

Sorry for the long post. I love Thailand. Planning on retiring there. It also helps my girlfriend is Thai 🤣🤣

For an American who’s never been abroad, Phuket (and Bangkok) are ideal. Phuket has a tourist path paved. Restaurants will have English menus. (You can also search for local food.) Hotels and tour guides speak English, to answer your questions. Plenty of adventure but easy to navigate.

A lot of hotels have universal outlets now so any plug shape works. (Note there’s a difference between having the right prong shape and having the right voltage.) Also, a lot of hotels have adapters you can borrow. Email the hotel in advance to ask for a picture of their outlets, if you want to be sure.

Advice on food. Tourist restaurants modify the flavors and spiciness levels toward a western palate. I prefer local food. I look for a no-frills restaurant (no aesthetic vibes), but with a few Thai customers. Our best meal last time was at outdoor restaurant stalls with plastic stools/tables, open-air but under a tin roof. Shanty vibes but the food was amazing (and genuinely spicy!).

We liked Phuket and stayed at 5 star Hotel called Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.  In May 2017, we paid about $110 a night.  I just looked and current May 2025 rates that include their huge buffet breakfast start about $135USD.  We had pre-arranged for the hotel to pick us up at airport for about $40 for the 40-45 minute ride to the hotel, but you might hire a Grab taxi for less; download the Grab app.
The property is beautiful and surrounded by lush mountains that extend into the water on each side so the beachfront is private.  There is a grill and bar near the beach for food and drinks too.  Besides the fantastic buffet breakfast in their main dining area, there are several other restaurants on the property.  One restaurant is located on an area that extends into center of the pool area; this has a buffet dinner and music entertainment for a reasonable fee.  We used ATMs I think to get Thai baht or we exchanged our cash at the hotel front desk.  Take newer date clean crisp  bills as their banks are picky, so some vendors won’t take US bills with any folds or marks on them.  
We took a cheap taxi into nearby town to do some touristy shopping and were told their nightlife there was lively but we aren’t into drinking/partying so we left before dark.  There are several local food places to eat at too.  The hotel can probably help you arrange tours to see the Thai sites or go to different nearby beaches or towns.  We were only there 2.5 days after our son’s wedding and we so enjoyed staying at the Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.

Another place we absolutely LOVE is Hoi An, Vietnam!  Plan to stay minimum of 4 days here.  It is great and sooo inexpensive and enchanting with all the lanterns that they are known for!  To get to Hoi An, fly to DaNang (see Dragon bridge and Hands bridge while there).  If you have time, do both Bangkok, Thailand and Hoi An, Vietnam while you are over there since flights between areas of Asia are very reasonable with Vietnam Airlines or Viet Jet. March and first part of December is good time to go to Hoi An for best weather but this place is beautiful all year and much to do.  Fall is their wet monsoon season so plan accordingly.
We stayed at Bel Marina Resort there recently (for 2nd time) which is located on a river for $94/night includes huge buffet breakfast; excellent service and accommodations.  Be sure to tell them it is your honeymoon ahead of time and you’ll likely get a free room upgrade.  Tell them Cynthia and Charles Petri sent you!  It was our 50th Anniversary and they gave us free upgrade and other special things.  Our “king” bed was size of two full size beds together; and had a balcony facing the pool.  It is a 5 minute walk or take a complimentary hotel bike to old town Hoi An for great local food (Bahn Mi sandwich rolls, Cao Lau, and Chicken Rice and spring rolls) and neat local crafts shopping (lanterns, custom leather goods, tailor shops, pop-up greeting cards at $1.40 each, Lulemon crossbody bag knock-offs for $5, silk sewn pictures, and beautiful abilone/shell decorated trivets and trays ($3 for 7” size trivet) for example. All shopping is negotiable!  
Be sure to book an evening boat cruise (light dinner with 2 cocktails) from the Bel Marina  included setting out a floating wish candle.  
We also recommend going to see the excellent Hoi An Memories Show (about $40-45 a person) across the Moon bridge (hotel can arrange it), which features a large outdoor beautiful production story about Hoi An’s beginnings with about 400 actors and special lights and effects.  Several free Mini pre-show performances begin about 5pm on different areas of the entertainment grounds so go early if you want to see these performances before the 7pm main show.  
Book a tour at the Silk Village to see the hands-on silk worm growing and processing to make silk fabric; so interesting.  
You’ll see gold-colored fancy covered golf cart taxis called ‘Hoi An Go’ around town.  For $20/person, you can book a 3 hour city/area tour.  They are a cheap taxi for getting around town too if you are tired of walking.  The city tour will include a stop at the round coconut boat rides which you must do and will drive through the rice fields with the water buffaloes.  We chose a shorter 45 minute ride on one round coconut boat for about $6-7USD/person, but think you can get cheaper price with negotiating when you show them cheaper pricing online, ha!
Be sure to visit the day markets and night markets there.  Lots of cheap local food and drinks in Hoi An all along the river next to old town Hoi An and on nearby parallel streets.  Lots of foot and body massage places too, very cheap. Bel Marina also offers spa services at reasonable prices.  Their restaurant on site has reasonable food prices too for lunch/dinner too.  
The hotel also has a scheduled free shuttle to the nearby beach, but their pool is huge.  They own the property next door too which has a roof top infinity pool with great views.  Just do it!!
We had no problem using our Apple chargers in their outlets in VN or Thailand, but if concerned, you can buy a travel converter for not too much.  Tipping is not customary or expected in VN or Thailand but is much appreciated if you do and if you return to a place, they give special service. Only tip $1 or 2.  
If you have the time and your dates are flexible, you could book a reasonable transpacific repositioning cruise to Asia (about 14-21 days) from Seattle/Vancouver, CA or vice versa in late Fall or Spring to get you over to Asia.  From there, you can catch a reasonable flight to where you want to go in Asia.  Flights will be your biggest cost unless you don’t mind economy.  Use Google flights to put a saved watch to where you want to go.  I’ve seen economy flights in economy for under $600 pop-up for one-way from Houston to Vietnam.  Use vacationstogo.com to find cheap cruises if that interests you.

First, congratulations to your wedding 

Then:
From woman to woman:
Stay away from the areas that have high prostitution, if you want to avoid your first heavy argument 🤣
Seriously, in some areas it’s nice and quiet and then for example if you go to Patong or Phuket mainstreet it’s horrible. 
I as a woman was harassed by women (?) in the Main Street of Phuket and in a party street in Bangkok. They can get quite aggressive for different reasons. Some even try to lure your man while you are standing next to them, others try to make money of you by pleasing you too 😆.

That’s the disclaimer. Apart from the high-prostitution areas it’s a very nice country to travel to. Enjoy!

Phuket is super touristy but if you book outside of Patong, closer to the old city, there are some lovely beaches. The best street food in Thailand is in Bangkok and Chiang Mai (best food in general is up north) but the islands have no shortage of good restaurants. I’d recommend Krabi or Koh Lanta if you want to mostly have beach time with stunning views. If you want a mix of beach and excursions and activities, Phuket can be a good HQ, as there are day trips to all of the most popular things in the area that leave from there.

        Actually just got back on Monday. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would! It's the cleanest city I've ever been to (even more so than Tokyo) and feels extremely well designed. The public transportation is great and it's very pedestrian friendly. It's also very diverse which is reflected in the food, architecture and culture. 

I spent 2 days there and didn't get to see everything I wanted to - probably would've added 1 more day. I'd say that it's the perfect place go before or after your main destination - ie Thailand, Bali, etc. 

The worst thing about Singapore is the weather. It's extremely hot and humid year round. It feels oppressive and worse than any other place I've been to in Southeast Asia. That said, there's AC basically everywhere.

I’m not familiar with the Bangkok airport specifically. But if I can afford to fly halfway around the world, I can afford the extra 100 bucks. And I guarantee that you’ll be sick from stress the whole time if you’re worrying about that tight connection. Not to mention the exhaustion of extra stops.

Do you have to fly in and out of Thailand from BKK? It would be a more efficient use of time to fly into Thailand BKK / DMK and out of Thailand HKT (Phuket). Or vice versa. Check the prices on seperate flight tickets or a multicity ticket instead of a return ticket. Even if it is a bit more, factor in the money you'd save by having one less domestic flight in Thailand.

    Yess, the direct flights are costing is way more

*Here updated ITINERARY 

5th Nov: Bangkok Arrival

Malls: Platinum Fashion Mall and December Mall are great for shopping. You could also consider Siam Paragon or Central world for a wider variety of stores.

Suggestion: If you have energy left, the Asiatique Riverfront is a unique night market on the river with great dining options.


6th Nov: Phuket Arrival & Night Markets

Markets: Try Chillva Market or Naka Market (Phuket Weekend Market) for local foods, clothes, and souvenirs.


7th Nov: Phuket Beaches & Bangla Road

Beaches: Beyond the main Patong Beach, consider Kata Beach or Karon Beach for a quieter vibe and scenic spots.

Nightlife: Bangla Road is lively, but if you’d like a more relaxed evening option, Kata Noi has some nice beachfront bars.


8th Nov: Phi Phi Island and Nearby Beaches

Boat Tour: A full-day boat tour around Phi Phi might include snorkeling stops. Consider booking a sunrise tour to avoid crowds at iconic spots like Maya Bay.


9th Nov: Old Phuket Town and Weekend Market

Old Phuket Town: Be sure to check out the vibrant Sino-Portuguese architecture and try some local cafés for a brunch experience.

Market: The Sunday Walking Street Market is very popular, with a variety of food and crafts.


10th Nov: Krabi Arrival

Markets: The Ao Nang Night Market offers a great range of local food options. Consider exploring Krabi Town Walking Street as well.


11th Nov: Railay Beach Day

Railay: The beach here is stunning. Besides relaxing, you can hike up to Railay Viewpoint if you’re up for it or explore Phra Nang Cave Beach nearby.


12th Nov: 7-Island Hopping Tour

Tour Options: Sunset tours are indeed less crowded. Most will include Poda Island, Chicken Island, and Phra Nang Cave Beach. Be sure to bring snorkeling gear or check with the tour operator for rentals.


13th Nov: Return to Bangkok + Shopping

Tofu Mall & Pratunam Market: Great choices for shopping, and you could also add MBK Center or Terminal 21 for more unique finds.


14th Nov: Shopping Day in Bangkok

Additional Option: You might want to consider Chatuchak Market if you're interested in a large selection of unique items, but it’s only open on weekends.



---

Additional Suggestions

Island Hopping (Alternative): If you want another unique island experience, Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai are beautiful and less crowded options near Phuket and Krabi.

Bangkok River Cruise: For a unique last night in Bangkok, you might enjoy a short river cruise with dinner along the Chao Phraya River.

    Reply:1
    Loved your suggestions. We're for sure going to consider the Bangkok river cruise for our last day and visit terminal 21 if we've time. Do you think I'll be able to shop (big shopaholic) properly if i follow the above itenary?

Where are you flying from? Japan and Korea aren't that close to Thailand and Vietnam so you'll lose a day traveling getting between those countries. I would consider doing Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia or Myanmar. You can start and just do a circle clockwise or counter clockwise. I'd suggest (not knowing where you are coming from however) starting in Hanoi in northern Vietnam. A month goes by fast but some must see places in my opinion to research and consider depending on what you like: (I would chose a few from each)

Vietnam: Hanoi, Halong Bay, Sapa, Hoi An, Hue, Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City. 

Cambodia: Siem Reap (Angkor Wat is a must see), Phnom Penh, Battanbang, Lake Tonle Sap.

Thailand: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Ayutthaya, Ko Toh, Chiang Rai

Laos: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Nong Kiau, Luang Namtha, Wat Phu, Phonsavan

Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kuching, Pulau Perhentian, Melaka

Myanmar: Maymyo, Kyaiktiyo, Bagon, Ngapali, Inle Lake, Mandalay and Yangon

Everywhere is safe, and everywhere can be dangerous if your stumbling around drunk by yourself at 3am. 

Flights between places can be super cheap and some are only reached by bus/train. There are some amazing ways to get between places by boat on the Mekong where the 8 hours of travel are quite the experience on a long boat. 

My first trip to SE Asia I went for a month and only went to 3 countries and made 8 stops and I felt rushed but I like to try to spend a minimum of a few days in each place. Went back for 9 months and only went to 6 countries and was spending usually a week minimum in each stop. 

You know how you like to travel so figure out what works but rushing it over there can be very frustrating because things don't always work on time and the weather can be tricky. 

I've never been to Japan or Korea. 

I did go to the Philippines and Manila, and El Nido were incredible but I only went to those two places to meet up with a friend who was on tour there and it was a spur of the moment thing. 

Hope this helps a little. I'm jealous. Enjoy.

Personally I would spend the entire month in Japan 😂 unless you think you’ll get sick of it. Why do you want to go to the places you’re considering?

Edit: maybe you could do a few days in HK, a week or so in Taiwan, and the rest of the time in Japan.

The worst parts of the Philippines are the cities. By far. They’re awful. The best thing about the Philippines are the islands and the small towns.

    Reply:1
    I was going to say this. Maybe skip the Philippines until they have more time to really get out there and do it justice. Go to Hong Kong for a couple of days instead, add the extra days to Japan or Thailand. Skip Singapore.

-----------------------------
Comment:
I would narrow it down to maybe 2-3 countries that are closer together. I did a 2 week trip to Thailand and Cambodia (ended up being more like 12 days on the ground after travel days). I wish I had had more time to just fully explore those two without hopping around every few days.

Given that, I think you can skip Bangkok and go straight to Chiang Mai or go down to Phuket and explore the islands from there. I know Cambodia wasn't listed but Angkor Wat was incredible and would highly highly recommend including in your itinerary.

-----------------------------
Comment:
If Philippines: You don’t need to stay in Manila because traffic is bad and there’s not much to see (except Intramuros, I guess?) unless you want to go shopping and drinking.

You can go to the beach like Boracay or Palawan instead and If you have more time, the Mt. Province area is really nice but the travel time is crazy (12 hours one way) and can only be done by bus from the city.

-----------------------------
Comment:
There is really no reason to pick 4. Aaia is easy, safe and affordable to get around in. And why would you want to spend a week in Singapore? You know it's especially a city filled with Super Wealthy Chinese correct? Not much to do and very little true culture that will be shared with you; skip it. Try Cambodia, Taiwan or Malaysia instead.

    Reply:1
    I’ll keep that in mind I think some other people said if I really want to go to Singapore limit it to 2-3 days max.

        I was recently in Singapore for 3 days. It was more than enough time to experience the food and the small amount of major sights

Comment:
If I was living in Korea, I’d do Japan as a long weekend. Osaka is a short flight from Seoul (assuming you live there). 

If you’re going to SEA I think it would depend on budget and interest. Most of SEA is pretty safe if you’re a reasonably alert traveller. 

Singapore - would be the most expensive, but arguably the safest. City vibes mainly.

Thailand - huge diversity between the islands, Bangkok, and the hills of the north (Chiang Mai). It’s worth seeing all three.

Vietnam - covers a huge amount of territory vertically. South (Ho Chi Minh), central (Hoi An), north (Ha Noi), and super north (Sapa) all offer very different experiences and also worth experiencing all.

I’m least experienced with the Philippines so I won’t comment on that, but much of Indonesia is wonderful to explore too.

I would also throw in a suggestion for Cambodia if you’re willing (Myanmar is also excellent but more unpredictable these days.)

Fairly easy to visit Vietnam/Thailand in the same trip and cover a decent amount while stretching a budget.

Even for a first trip to Japan, you need like 2 weeks for the cities you played plus day trips, week and a half minimum for those 3 cities only.

Singapore isn't even a one day city, let alone one week. It's a layover city where you can pop out of the airport and have dinner somewhere and get a feel for Singaporean life. 

I don't know what you're doing for a week in those Filipino cities. Get out and be close to the water.

    Reply:1
    Well I guess since we’re living in Korea even though we haven’t gone before we could go back to Japan on a long weekend after the first trip 🤔 

For a first trip where would we absolutely have to visit in Japan if you had to choose?

Right thinking to move Singapore to 2 days if we keep it on the list

        Reply:2
        Japan is beautiful you could do the major places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa and be lost there forever. Also anywhere up north or going to Mount Fuji.

Comment:
Singapore sucks. So much more to see in the other four with a week each.

That said, your plans are a lil too ambitious and most of your time will be spent traveling and not enjoying the location if your time is very tight and you have a strict 4 week limit. Consider cutting down the cities per country like Thailand could be Bangkok and Phuket and skip Chang Mai. Phillipines go to Palawan or a similar island instead of Manila. Maybe stop in Manila for a couple days only and then go to enjoy the beach

Comment:
First of all, all those countries for just 1 month will be a rush and you wouldn't see much. You'll just be wasting a lot of time travelling on planes/buses/ferries...

Unless you only want to visit cities (which to me aren't that interesting for more than 2-3 days) I feel you'll be missing too much. You'd be better off picking 1 or two of those. 

You can easily spend a month in all those countries (other than Singapore - 2-3 days max is enough).

I'd decide what you want to do most. Beaches, history, sight seeing, nightlife... And then decide on just a couple of those. Otherwise if you try to fit too much in you'll maybe only get to visit 1-2 places per country. 

Personally I'd choose Japan or the Philippines. Never been to Japan but want to go, an dive spent 2 months island hopping the Philippines. 

You can do a lot of stuff yourself. I terms of getting around 12go.asia is good for booking buses/trains/ferries... 

If you are after just day tours - Klook, Get Your Guide and Viator are good for finding and booking stuff. But there will alos be others locally that could be cheaper that aren't on those apps.

Sounds like an epic graduation celebration! To avoid burnout, I’d suggest sticking to 3-4 major stops. Start with Thailand (Bangkok and Phuket for the food and beaches), then head to Vietnam (maybe Hanoi for culture or Ho Chi Minh for energy). After that, visit your friend in Singapore, and if you’re up for it, stop in Taiwan (Taipei is super fun) before heading to Japan.

If you’re considering China, Hong Kong or Macau could be quick but fascinating stops. Check out this guide that helped me when I was traveling in China [https://gowithguide.com/China](https://gowithguide.com/China) Congrats on med school, and enjoy the adventure! 🎉

If you're into "adventure, landscape, nature, thrill" then you can cut both Bangkok and Singapore down to a minimum or totally. Do a 5-day PADI dive course at Krabi. Personally I wouldn't bother with Singapore. There is none of those 4 things you want there IMO. Go visit the Golden Triangle or something in Thailand or do some treking.

    Reply:1
    Phuket too. Have a look on Travelfish. There are a dozen islands (many accessible from Krabi) more fitting for what you’re after in Thailand.

-----------------------------
Comment:
You can easily visit Tiger Cave and the hot springs as a half-day trip from Krabi—there’s no need to spend the night there. I’d also suggest cutting down your time in Phuket unless partying is your priority; it’s a bit too touristy for my taste.

For accommodations in Krabi, consider Ao Nang or Noppharat Thara. Both are fantastic options and far better than staying in Krabi Town. From these spots, you can easily visit Railay and Tonsai Beach by canoe or a small boat. In general, Ao Nang makes an excellent base for exploring the nearby islands and attractions.

You should look for the multi city options in Skyscanner/Google flights/ITA Matrix. Here you can put in Europe to Krabi and return Indonesia to Europe. Look for options bookable on one tickets, ie all flights with airlines who work together. Then go direct to the main airline (usually for the longhaul flight) and again use multi city option. If you need flights within Asia, then book those separately.

*Here updated ITINERARY 

5th Nov: Bangkok Arrival

Malls: Platinum Fashion Mall and December Mall are great for shopping. You could also consider Siam Paragon or Central world for a wider variety of stores.

Suggestion: If you have energy left, the Asiatique Riverfront is a unique night market on the river with great dining options.


6th Nov: Phuket Arrival & Night Markets

Markets: Try Chillva Market or Naka Market (Phuket Weekend Market) for local foods, clothes, and souvenirs.


7th Nov: Phuket Beaches & Bangla Road

Beaches: Beyond the main Patong Beach, consider Kata Beach or Karon Beach for a quieter vibe and scenic spots.

Nightlife: Bangla Road is lively, but if you’d like a more relaxed evening option, Kata Noi has some nice beachfront bars.


8th Nov: Phi Phi Island and Nearby Beaches

Boat Tour: A full-day boat tour around Phi Phi might include snorkeling stops. Consider booking a sunrise tour to avoid crowds at iconic spots like Maya Bay.


9th Nov: Old Phuket Town and Weekend Market

Old Phuket Town: Be sure to check out the vibrant Sino-Portuguese architecture and try some local cafés for a brunch experience.

Market: The Sunday Walking Street Market is very popular, with a variety of food and crafts.


10th Nov: Krabi Arrival

Markets: The Ao Nang Night Market offers a great range of local food options. Consider exploring Krabi Town Walking Street as well.


11th Nov: Railay Beach Day

Railay: The beach here is stunning. Besides relaxing, you can hike up to Railay Viewpoint if you’re up for it or explore Phra Nang Cave Beach nearby.


12th Nov: 7-Island Hopping Tour

Tour Options: Sunset tours are indeed less crowded. Most will include Poda Island, Chicken Island, and Phra Nang Cave Beach. Be sure to bring snorkeling gear or check with the tour operator for rentals.


13th Nov: Return to Bangkok + Shopping

Tofu Mall & Pratunam Market: Great choices for shopping, and you could also add MBK Center or Terminal 21 for more unique finds.


14th Nov: Shopping Day in Bangkok

Additional Option: You might want to consider Chatuchak Market if you're interested in a large selection of unique items, but it’s only open on weekends.



---

Additional Suggestions

Island Hopping (Alternative): If you want another unique island experience, Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai are beautiful and less crowded options near Phuket and Krabi.

Bangkok River Cruise: For a unique last night in Bangkok, you might enjoy a short river cruise with dinner along the Chao Phraya River.

    Reply:1
    Loved your suggestions. We're for sure going to consider the Bangkok river cruise for our last day and visit terminal 21 if we've time. Do you think I'll be able to shop (big shopaholic) properly if i follow the above itenary?

Do you snorkel or dive? We snorkeled in the Surin islands (stayed in Khao Lak which is much closer to the departure than Phuket) and it was wonderful.

I live on an island so im familiar with the "sport"

        Got it, no need to shift if that's not something you were looking for. Adventure, thrill, etc isn't super clear for what you want to do.

            snorkeling does fit into the category - don't take me wrong - but i would probably not change my itinerary just for that.

maybe quads, ziplines, safari, kayak, rafting might be more towards what im looking for

If you're into "adventure, landscape, nature, thrill" then you can cut both Bangkok and Singapore down to a minimum or totally. Do a 5-day PADI dive course at Krabi. Personally I wouldn't bother with Singapore. There is none of those 4 things you want there IMO. Go visit the Golden Triangle or something in Thailand or do some treking.

    Reply:1
    Phuket too. Have a look on Travelfish. There are a dozen islands (many accessible from Krabi) more fitting for what you’re after in Thailand.

-----------------------------
Comment:
You can easily visit Tiger Cave and the hot springs as a half-day trip from Krabi—there’s no need to spend the night there. I’d also suggest cutting down your time in Phuket unless partying is your priority; it’s a bit too touristy for my taste.

For accommodations in Krabi, consider Ao Nang or Noppharat Thara. Both are fantastic options and far better than staying in Krabi Town. From these spots, you can easily visit Railay and Tonsai Beach by canoe or a small boat. In general, Ao Nang makes an excellent base for exploring the nearby islands and attractions.

    by full day i meant a day trip - which probably takes 6-8 hours - im not staying for the night!

Take bus from Krabi to Hat Yai then take a train. Don't drive. Take a train in Malaysia as well.

    Reply:1
    Thanks! Another user recommended driving as it would give us a chance to improvise stops on the way if we see something we like. Do trains in Malaysia work well / would you avoid certain areas?

        Reply:2
        Trains in Malaysia work great. No certain areas to avoid, but the north tends to be much more conservative and less interesting, IMHO. I took the commuter train that stopped at every city. The ferry to Georgetown was a nice experience. 

Both countries have pretty high road fatalities. They can be stressful to drive.

Koh lanta to koh lipe ferry, then to langkawai, then onto George Town

    Reply:1
    Yes, Lipe to Langkawi, and onward to George Town is a fantastic trip!

-----------------------------
Comment:
YES! Go to the Perhentians. It's the perfect time. Bear in mind you won't be able to drink much if that's important to you, but other than that it's pretty cool.

There's not a huge amount to see in Trang / Satun at that time of year. Hat Yai is nice enough for a night or two. Koh Lipe will still be open and it's fantastic, but most of the islands in the Tarutao national park will close down until October. There is a big difference in climate between the east and west coasts at that time of year. Not sure if the ferry from Koh Lipe to Langkawi will still be open but that could be an option.

And for what it's worth... Krabi to KL is do-able, but it's not really honeymoon worthy. Personally I'd rather go somewhere romantic, like Luang Prabang or something like that, and just chill there for a week or so.

    Reply:1
    We thought a week in the Krabi resort was enough chilling 😂 we’re actually keen on some sort of adventure, hence why the trip down to KL. Would you say that the east coast at that time of the year is better? We’d love to get a full experience of Malaysia but we understand the limitations imposed by the season.

        Reply:2
        Whereabouts in Krabi? There's loads of adventurous stuff to do there! The Perhentians have good diving / snorkelling but they're waaaaay more chilled.

In all honesty there's not a huge amount of tourist infrastructure or things to see in the border region, and some parts are kinda dodgy. Georgetown is pretty cool, and the Genting Highlands closer to KL are worth a look, but for the most part it's just administrative towns and so on.

The east coast will have much clearer water and potentially less monsoonal weather at that time of year.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Personally I would skip the whole Satun/Trang area and just fly from Krabi to Langkawi and then again to Georgetown etc. The time spent traveling between them is kind of just wasted because it's not nearly as interesting as what's at the destinations. Plus you only have two weeks so why spend a few days in traveling between locations. 

Flights are dirt cheap if you book in advance. After Georgetown you can get straight on a train in Butterworth and go wherever you want on the east coast then wind up in KL

Personally I would fly Krabi to Penang to Luang Prabang to KL and skip everything else. That gets you beaches to food/culture to big city/shopping to amazing romantic French/Laotian town.

    Reply:1
    Thanks! You’re the second person recommending Laos over other Malaysian destination. We do like the idea but we’d still like to give the east coast a chance. What itinerary would you recommend from the Perhentians? Is there anything else south of that side worth visiting? Someone said Taman Negara is nice, and maybe there’s more on the way down to Singapore?

Comment:
Ao Nang itself is a tourist trap. But, in a fun way. Without a scooter, you'll want to stay close to the main corner. Take a look at Google Maps and zoom in on Ao Nang Beach. Now, notice the 90 degree turn on road 4203 (where MR.Ruut Fruit Shop & smoothie is located). Both directions from that corner is the "walking street". Along the beach it extends to around where Ankoa Homemade Ice Cream is. Going up into town it extends to around where Saad Kitchen is located.

So, your best bet is to find lodging somewhere in, or very near, that area. Don't book anything too far away from the main road, else you'll end up needing a scooter.

A few days in Ao Nang is enough to make you want to go see other places. You can take a boat to Phi Phi for a few days. You can make it a day trip. But that just leads to regret of not staying longer.

    Reply:1
    Thanks for your advice! Luckily I've booked a hotel close to this Road. Phi Phi is on my bucket list, I was also thinking about getting a grab/bolt to some more distant spots around ao nang if it won't be too expensive.

A little off the topic, if i dont have a international driving licence, what would be the chances to be stopped by the police while driving?

Thailand is SEA 101 in a nutshell. Easy to navigate and is eye opening. Then Vietnam is the jewel in the region 😉

        Angkor Wat is definitely worth seeing, but that plus a bunch of the other temples in the area only needs about 3 days

            Can do the temples around in a day if you're up early enough I feel. S21 in Phnom Penh is good to visit and very interesting. 

I can imagine people enjoying Cambodia, but I just had a bad experience with the locals.

If you do go to the Philippines, spend as little time in Manila as possible. 1 day is enough. Not saying it's a totally bad city, but spending more time in the other islands is a MUCH better choice

    Second this. I'd rate it as second worst city I've ever been to, Port Moresby is number one.

        Funny how the two most dangerous cities (and countries?) in Asia are the Christian ones. I tried to walk out of a hotel compound in Port Moresby in broad daylight and a security guard actually grabbed me by the neck, dragged me back inside and informed me in strong terms that the ‘rascals’ will kill me if I walk down that street.

        I really like places like Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta, Mumbai and Delhi, but they're not for the average traveller... 

Also, all of the cities can be nice depending on where you go. People go to the world's biggest slum in Mumbai and complain about how filthy it is. You just gotta know the right places

    Reply:1
    Enjoyed Manila and wrote this on PH sub, a lot of Filipinos didnt believe me. there are a lot of things to see, i would say for history etc it is one of few places in the PH to go to. I don't like sea and islands so other sites from top 10 in that country didn't impress me but I know that people have different tastes. Somebody who likes beaches etc may not like Manila

    Reply:1
    I have family there and I would not disagree. Manila is an embarrassment.

    Reply:1
    Just adding to the comments - Manila is fine for a day of you have to be there, but if you could skip it then do. I did a group tour for the beginning of my trip in the Philippines, so had to spend a night there.

My taxi driver was rude, made me pay extra for taking a toll road he wanted to take. Ended getting pulled over by the police for either being impatient at a light or cutting someone off at. Alight when he shouldn't have been going - he got out of it for pointing he had me in the back driving me...

The appeal of the Philippines is the islands and natural beauty. It's one of my favourite countries - I'm not sure 12 days would do it enough justice though as its not the eaiset to get from place to place. It usually involved flights back through Manila or Cebu.

That said coron and el nido are worth a visit (though can be touristy).

Do not miss out on Siem Reap, Cambodia.

It's an incredible SE Asia experience and the temples there will blow your mind. 3 or 4 days is enough. The floating villages are also a must see.

You'll remember it for the rest of your life.
By comparison, Phuket is mehhhhh, but kinda decent. Touristy, commercialised, inauthentic. Don't do Phuket for a beach experience unless you want to see lots of bright pink overweight sunburned Russians.

Went to both destinations last year.

Been in Vietnam for the last couple weeks and absolutely loving it. If you’re into adventure travel think about doing the Ha giang loop. I did a 3D 2N motorbike tour and it’s been one of my best travel experiences so far. Driving through small rural villages and breathtaking scenery.    In Ninh Binh now and its really beautiful, surrounded by rice paddies and limestones karsts.  Beaches are better in Thailand though and it will be a lot warmer than northern Vietnam (though the winter in Vietnam is nothing compared to Canadian winters)

I’d go Vietnam. 

Very good food, amazing people, different landscapes from beaches to mountains, hectic cities and quiet villages, and your budget stretches the furtherest by far compared to a Thailand, or Malaysia etc. 

With 11 days, you could do the length of the country which is essentially a vertical strip meaning you get a mixture of climates and experiences.

Phuket is overtouristed and overpriced.

There's not much nature in Manila.  

Bali you will see plenty of beautiful outdoors everything.

Thailand there's also a good amount of nature, the country lends itself to outdoor exploration, and very to get around. Great food and fantastic beaches. This is probably the best single country for the amount of time you've got.

Can't go wrong with Vietnam but generally there isn't as much nature as some other places.

Your title says East Asia which is generally used to refer to Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan, and does not include Southeast Asia.

-----------------------------
Comment:
First thing first, South East Asia and East Asia are two different places. East Asia includes China, Japan and Korea. You're going to South East Asia. 

Jakarta is an interesting choice for a first timer to say the least. Alcohol is expensive in Indonesia, so it's good that you're not a drinker. Do check the weather. I think it's the rainy season there in January, possibly the wettest month. 17-day isn't a lot. Bali and Java are also quite far away from the rest of SEA.

If you do mind the rain, fly to KL or Penang then do island hoppings from Langkawi, Malaysia to various islands in Southern Thailand. Fly to Bangkok and end your trip in Jakarta before going home.

    Reply:1
    Sorry, a typo on my part. I’m indeed going to Southeast Asia. 

Yeah, Jakarta has an interesting feedback. People love or hate it or just completely avoid it. I fly in about 5:30 pm and I fly to Jakarta because I got a good deal.

Yeah, that’s not a bad idea. I might check that out. Thanks for the suggestion.

Comment:
If it's your first time in SE Asia, I think it is a bit ambitious. Indonesia is probably not a good place to start and you might be unpleasantly overwhelmed. Thailand has much better tourist infrastructure.

Also, most countries in the world would be hard to check out in 2-3 days as you mentioned you planned for Vietnam. Vietnam is a large country of over 100 million people and a few distinct regions.

I'd recommend you focus on one big city and one chill island destination in a single country with 2 weeks time. Like, fly to Bangkok and check it out for 4-5 days and then do 10 days or so in southern Thailand. Or do something similar in Vietnam.

    Reply:1
    On reflection, I agree with you. It’s probably too ambitious and I probably have factored into how long it takes to get from one city  to another city. I’m based in London and internal flights within Europe and the UK are very quick. 

So what I’m thinking I do a night Inkaar take a plane to Bali for three days Bali to Thailand explore crabby Bangkok maybe one night in Singapore and then back to Jakarta

I haven't been to Indonesia, but I do love Thailand. I would recommend spending time in Krabi. I loved the place, and you could go Island Hopping and to Railey Beach. All the places are wonderful. Honestly, Singapore is quite small, but there is so much you can do. I loved both of the places!

for beaches - hands down Philippines - boracay/palawan. Krabi - is nice, Bali is just water(wahahahaha). you go there for the vibe🤣

bali,bangkok, vietnam will spoil you with good food! very cheap! 

Singapore - not my choice as i can go there during layover.

Don't bother spending your short time in Jakarta, I'd head straight down to Bandung or Yogyakarta, then go on from there.

    OP is already flying all the way from London to Jakarta and arriving in the late afternoon. I think the last thing they would want to do is to immediately get on a train to go straight to another destination.

And Jakarta is a great city to explore for a day or two with plenty to see and do. Fantastic food scene there. Let the influencer cunts stay in Bali or Gili T while those willing to take a step off the beaten path enjoy the delights of the capital.

        Reply:2
        Yes sure there is good food, but that is true of basically everywhere in SEA.  I've spent many weeks in Jakarta, it's not bad, personally I prefer to spend my time in just about any other city in Indonesia.  But I agree after a 20+ hour flight after landing in JKT all I also would want to do is grab a bite have a very long sleep!

My suggested 17 days in SE Asia

Congrats on the good deal flight to Jakarta. Now leave Jakarta 😄 Go spend 3-4 jet lag recovery days in Bali. They also have a major international airport there, so no need to go back through Jakarta for your next stops. 

Bali -> Singapore. I know a lot of people think Singapore is boring. It’s like the Zurich of Asia - but if you’re a foodie, it’s a must-stop. Great food town. 2-3 days in Singapore

Singapore —> Georgetown, Malaysia (Penang). Foodtopia tour continues. 3 days here

Penang -> Phuket/Krabi for 3 days

Phuket -> Bangkok for 3 days

If you’re done now - fly back home. If you had cut back the time a bit (2 days instead of 3, etc) - you may be able to squeeze one more stop in. Do you have to fly back through Jakarta?

    Reply:1
    Thank you for your suggestion. That’s really helpful.

I will spend a night because I arrive at 5:30. I land in Jakarta after a 20+ our flight. 

And your recommendations for places in that you can suggest in Bali. 

I have a few people from a company that work in Singapore so I may catch up with them when I’m there. 

Your itinerary has given me a lot to think about

        Reply:2
        Yeah that’s fair. Get some recovery zzz’s in Jakarta before moving on. 

I’ll let others make Bali suggestions - I tend to be in the “off the beaten path / unplug/ hide from people in the jungle” camp - so someplace like Cepik Villa in Sidemen.  But you might want a more typical beach resort hustle/bustle experience near town. For a trip like yours you might want to alternate between rural and major city. I tend to get burnt out if it’s just city city city

            Reply:3
            Yep and dude what a suggestion. In my head, I just think Bali is a party place. That villa looks amazing and may go ahead and book it.

Looks like a great place just switch off. Silly question what did you read from Bali to get to that villa?

                I just do whatever the New York Times 36 Hours travel column tells me to 😂

Oh - and in Singapore - be sure to try Kaya toast and the vending machine that sells slices of cake in a jar. I’m obsessed with that vending machine.

You don’t necessarily need to “return” to Jakarta to get to Thailand. There are direct flights from Bali to Bangkok and Phuket. So that may free up a day of your itinerary. Still, if you truly intend to “explore” Java and Bali and spend a week in Thailand, you’re not going to have time for a day in Singapore, let alone 2-3 days in Vietnam on top of that. Just count it out: 2 days in Jakarta; at least 2 in Yogyakarta to see the temples and palaces; presumably you then want to hike Mt. Bromo, which will require another 2 based on what I’ve read; now you’re left with 4 days in Bali to allocate however you choose; then a week in Thailand makes 17. Have a great time regardless of what you decide.

    Thanks for your comments. I think someone suggestions if you like hiking than skin Java. I normally do but limited on time and want to have something more chilled.

Yeah, I’m gonna try and break it down . Maybe a night in Jakarta spend two days in Bali or three days then go to Thailand and then maybe do a day in Singapore.

Thank you once again

        I’m not sure what they mean by that. Java is huge. There’s plenty of good hiking across the island. Anyway, looking at your responses to other comments, I would suggest taking some time to think about what you really want to see and do on this trip, then map it out using various tools like Google Maps and Google Flights to get an idea of driving distances, flight times, airport locations, etc., and recognizing that every new location will add transit time, planning time, packing time, airport waiting time and more that’ll eat into your actual vacation time. Seventeen days will fly by quickly. Have as much fun as you can.

            Reply:3
            Sorry, a big typo my part. The person mentioned Java is great for hiking and for this trip I’m not feeling like a huge hike basically.

Thank you for the advice and taken fully on board and this is gonna be an amazing trip

Instead of Hue or Da Nang, seriously consider Ninh Binh - even if you just go for 1 full day to experience the scenery. It was one of my favourite places not just in Vietnam, but all of SE Asia. The karst landscape is insane.

    Hadn't been recommended this until this post, thanks for the recommendation!

        Reply:2
        I've visited Vietnam twice, the first time I skipped Ninh Binh so made sure to go there the next time and I am so glad I did.

Also Dalat is one of the coolest places in Vietnam, I've been twice and would happily go again.

If you want a ridiculous day out, visit Ba Na Hills from Da Nang, it's kind of everything I hate but I absolutely loved it.

            Reply:3
            How long did you do Ninh Binh for? Would it be rushed in a day trip?

                Reply:4
                I spent 2 nights there which was a good amount of time to see everything, but you could do it as 1 night stopover between Hanoi and Hue. I really mean Tam Coc when I say Ninh Binh btw, Ninh Binh is the town near it, but Tam Coc is where you want to visit and stay in and the bus stops there. The main things to do is the boat trip and the viewpoint, but I enjoyed just exploring all the different roads and seeing the different temples, caves and landscapes.

Day 1: Bus from Hanoi to Ninh Binh is around 2 hours. Do a boat trip down the river which takes about 2 hours. Wander around Tam Coc, explore a little bit, spend the night.

Day 2: Walk up to the viewpoint, see Mua cave. You can rent bikes or get a short taxi to get here. Explore a bit more, maybe Bich Dong Pagoda. Get on the overnight bus to Hue.

Ha long bay is a long day at most. A day trip from Hanoi. Could prob lose a day in Bangkok. Maybe even a day in chiang mai.

You plan on doing a overnight cruise in Ha Long? A lot of people here are saying skip it but I say to go to Bai Tu bay. It’s a part of Ha Long but away from the hundreds of ship more secluded and what Ha Long use to be.

    Reply:1
    I have been interested in the Ha Long cruise - to be clear, do you mean do Bai Tu as a part of the cruise or on its own thing?

        Reply:2
        Bai Tu Bay is part of greater Ha Long Bay. It’s just a little further out. It’s like going to the Grand Canyon but instead of the main parking area where the tour buses are at you go a mile up the road away from the crowds. I did an overnight cruise to Bai Tu Bay. There were maybe another 4 cruise ships there. You can book it while in Hanoi.

        I tacked on an extra day there just because I was pretty tired at that point in my trip.  I did some cycling in the countryside and relaxed at the hotel pool.  Otherwise, I agree that Hoi A doesn’t need much time.

        Reply:2
        I'd spend about three days in Hoi An. It's quite lovely as a bit of a break from travel hustle with a lot of little side activities to do. Sit by the river, have a beer, relax. Watch the sunset. Very romantic place.

    This is excellent advice. Ha giang loop is absolutely amazing, My wife and I did it this year at 58 years old and had a blast.

Skip ha long bay honestly. It’s one day at most. Instead, what I would recommend is to shave another day off of da nang/ hoi an and doing the ha giang loop for three days. Best experience of my life.

You could use one less day in hcm and be fine.

4 days in Bangkok is a lot to be honest. How are you getting around by car or bus? Krabi is a good place to use as a jump off point. Ko phi phi is really a day thing, it’s small…. Plenty of other island around krabi to explore.  Railay is very chill aand offers plenty of excursions

-----------------------------
Comment:
I’d lose a day or two in Bangkok, depending on what time your flight lands/how long your travel day is. I’d lose a day in chang Mai and try and make it out to Pai (northern thailand) for a night or two. Taking a day off in Hanoi and ha long bay, and using that time to travel to Nihn Bihn area (tam coc) specifically. I’d lose a day in da nang 1 night in Da nang is more than enough in my opinion. And I’d lose a day or two in Ho Chi Minh. And I’d use those three days to travel to a little island in the south of Vietnam to chill before the long journey home. Unfortunately I don’t have any recommendations on which island is best.

Literally on a plane back from a two month Southeast Asia trip. Going to echo others and say skip the Ha Long bay cruise, it was our low point.

Please please please go to Railay Beach in Krabi. It’s only accessible by boat, but is just the most incredible beach I’ve ever been to. Most people make a day trip from Krabi, but we stayed on the island feet from the beach. It’s an incredible experience.

    Reply:1
    So you'd recommend staying on Railay over Ao Nang then?

I'm assuming you're flying between all those locations, otherwise you'll need to modify that plan drastically.   


For Thailand part: Bangkok- Krabi - Chiang Mai is a good order, there are direct flights in-between.   phiphi is a daytrip destination.    


For Vietnam:    


Ha Long - possibly a daytrip or a night on a boat in the bay, definitely not 2 nights there.   


You don't need that much time in Ho chi Minh- I'd recommend just 2 days. It's like Bangkok, but with worse everything.

    Reply:1
    Yeah flying is the main thing. Figured domestic flights with a backpack wouldn't be too much a ball ache!

Phi Phi is now a day trip and it's looking like Ha Long is a nightboat, but undecided between that and day trip.

 Thanks for your help, and the "worse everything" made me laugh!

5 days in Da Nang and Hoi An is way too much IMO. 2 full days is enough IMO.

I would work in one full day in Ninh Binh.

    Reply:1
    Ninh Binh has definitely been fit in now. I have removed Da Nang all together, with Hoi An being two days. Is that the right move or any other places in Viet more with that time, in your opinion?

-----------------------------
Comment:
3 nights in Hoi An is a night too long in my opinion. It's pretty small. 1-2 nights is enough.

I would keep all four nights in Bangkok to start the trip because it's a big city with a lot to see and because you will be jet lagged for the first 1-2 days.

I personally don't think Chiang Mai warrants four nights but some people do, and you may be arriving late on the first day if coming from Koh Phi Phi.  I'm seeing one nonstop flight from Krabi  to Chiang Mai and it leaves at 7pm.

    Reply:1
    Yeah Hoi An has been changed to 2 nights now. Exactly my thoughts with Bangkok. Based on what people have said, it looks like Phi Phi is a daytrip now so that makes it easier flight wise :) With the new days opened up, where else in Thailand would you suggest? Any other islands or cities?

        Reply:2
        Well to me the most impressive thing to see in the region is Angkor Wat. There are direct flights from Bangkok to Siem Reap, and there are direct flights from Siem Reap to Hanoi on Vietjet Airlines and Vietnam Airlines.

If you take a day out of Chiang Mai, Hoi An, and Phi Phi, you could fit in three nights in Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples like Beng Melea and Koh Ker.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Like others have said, shave a day off of Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and HCMC each. I would replace Ha Long with Cat Ba island. Same vibes, little quieter. Ninh Binh and Ha Giang are good north Vietnam things to replace the city time as well

    Reply:1
    All of those things have applied, thanks. Ninh Binh is a definite now, however I'm just not sure Ha Giang loop is for me, risk wise. Do you suggest anywhere else to fill the time? Thanks!

        Reply:2
        For Ha Giang, you can get easy riders, and join a tour with a local driving you around. Much safer that way, that's what I did. 


A little harder to get to, but quite beautiful is the Cao Bang Provence, and the Ban Gioc Waterfall. There are 1-2 day tours that you can arrange with your hostel to see that and other stuff in the region 


Near Hue is Phong Nha, which has massive caves and dense jungle  to explore


SaPa is the place for rice paddy hikes and what not. A little touristy, but that's ok. 


Khao Sok Lake in Thailand is quite nice as well


Siem Riep in Cambodia has Angkor Wat, the most impressive ruin complex anywhere in the world. It can be done via overnight busses between Bangkok and HCMC, but flights might be easier. 


Please check the annual weather ahead of time for wherever you go. Phong Nha is flooded for 2 months of the year, Ha Giang is having landslides due to rainy season right now

When you say nature, what kind of things are you looking for? We snorkeled in the Surin islands, visited the Doi inthanon national park, and visited an elephant sanctuary (no riding). You're spending a lot of time in cities; do you want to be out in nature more?


Also at that time, you're right to go to the Andaman sea side of Thailand in the south. The Gulf area has more rain at that time.


The best food we had was in Chaing Mai, Hanoi, and Saigon. Have bun cha in Hanoi if you eat pork - it was amazing!!

    Thanks for the suggestions. I've since added Ninh Binh and Khao Sok to the itinerary to try and even things out! I think there's an elephant sanctuary in Khao Sok 😄

        Up to you of course. There are also sanctuaries in Chiang Mai, Koh Samui, and others. Many beautiful elephants to be rescued unfortunately!

Comment:
How are you getting between these places exactly? Have you structured the cities this way for a specific reason? 

You've chosen a lot of big cities, I see, which is fine if that's what you like. I understand the desire to move a lot and see a lot, but you should consider the amount of time you lose by trying to move too often. Time in transit, to and from, time checking in, packing and moving hotels, etc.

Ha long bay is pretty underwhelming, Imo. If you must, just book a day trip from hanoi. Da nang isn't bad but it's not special. In the end, you'll enjoy it no matter what you choose, I'm sure, so no worries, but after a month there, ninh binh was by far the best place I saw. I'd recommend three days there. You could cut hue, da nang, or a couple days from HCMC. 

Ko phi phi is pretty, like Krabi, but it's just like a small Ibiza type thing. The over night trip to phi phi leh is nice, but that's about it. You could save time by skipping it and hitting Koh Phang an before Krabi instead for the full money party, which is more memorable. Turn just fly from Krabi to CM.

    Reply:1
    It's mainly been for the fact that you can fly between them fairly cheaply and easily, and through what my research has deemed the 'have to do' things in these countries. Hence why I wanted to see what everyone had to say. Thanks for the tips!

Fascinating post. I honestly don't think India has gotten any better - if anything it's worse - so your observations are very intriguing.

Do you think it's possible that you're just that much better at travelling? Could it be that your confidence and vibe have changed from intimidated/nervous/frightened first timer to the present day experienced/confident/fuck-off-and-don't bug-me persona so the scammers/touts simply don't waste their time on you?

In any case good on you.

Vietnam is absolutely worth the trip! An amazing country. We were there for a week and it wasn't enough time! Already thinking about going back. Hanoi is chaotic. Its Asia on hard-mode. Amazing all the way through, but i would not call it relaxing. I would skip Ha Long Bay. We found it crowded and dirty, kind of depressing. Consider Tam Coc- often called Ha Long bay on land. We did both and loved Tam Coc way more. You can rent a car to bring you, its very easy. Just ask your hotel or I can PM you someone we used.

        Agree w the comment that 8 nights in HA and DN is probably long, given the length of the trip..  I'd  add the two nights during your return turn trip to Ha Noi and use those two nights in Ninh Binh (but you can probably get away w one).  That said, if you want to stay at a nice resort in Da Nang for some R&R such as the Hyatt Regency or Intercontinental, and add day trip to Hue, that probably works too.  They're away enough from the busy city but has direct beach access.  Have a great trip.  You'll have a great time regardless.

I would hate doing that trip with a suitcase (even Rome would be a pain never mind on and off buses and trains and across uneven paths) and with a day sack as well I would go for the 55l backpack. It will be plenty. But I have never travelled with a suitcase and detest them so am very biased!

-----------------------------
Comment:
I would pack in a carry on backpack (30-40l). No risk of lost luggage, quicker to check in and leave the airports, easier to carry around, and doesn't take much space in a hotel room (and rooms in Japan are tiny). 

Lugging a huge suitcase across 6 countries seems exhausting to me but people have different preferences so you need to figure out what works for you.

I am just about to leave Thailand after 3.5 weeks here and I'd suggest you cut down on your destinations a lot.

Transiting between places took a lot longer than we had anticipated *every time* so we lost more time than expected transiting so would definitely change that were we to do the trip again. 

I'd suggest not staying anywhere for less than 3 nights, if not 4. We did mostly 3 night stops and a couple of 2s and the 2s felt pretty much pointless and the 3s felt rushed

Siem Reap temple complex is almost like an outdoor museum, and the huge trees with roots in the temple complex add to the incredible atmosphere.  It’s a once in a lifetime experience without equal and we’ve seen quite a few wonders of the world.  In Chiang Mai there are things to see and do and it’s interesting enough but doesn’t come close to Siem Reap.  If I could only choose 1, it would be Siem Reap 1000 times over.  When we went, the guide wanted to meet us at 4:30 am at our hotel.  I said no way, I’m on vaca, what on earth for ? He said “to see the sun rise over Ankhor Watt”.  We compromised and met slightly later, it was still dark.  It was totally worth it !

        Why do you think it is so different from Bangkok that it's worthwhile giving the magnificent Siem Reap a miss? What do you have in Chiang Mai that even compares to Angkor Wat? Chiang Mai these days with its horrendous traffic, digital nomad cafes and smog is just another very busy Thai town. Have you ever been?

Siem Reap without a doubt. Angkor Wat is a must see. Chiang Mai is just okay.

When are you planning to travel?  Look at the monthly temperatures and when the wet seasons are.  That might help you decide.  I’m sure either trip would be amazing.

    Which part of Langkawi would you recommend I should base myself on? Ideally, a town vibe with a beautiful sandy beach nearby and with lots of restaurants, etc. Thanks.

    not sure this is a good choice. .bear in mind that Langkawi is a conservative Muslim place...

Why so many different islands? Are you aware of how much traveling you need to do to see all of this? And how are you traveling? 

In 6 weeks you can see pretty much every highlight in Thailand. I'd swap a few islands for Khao Yai and Erawan.

    Reply:1
    We love islands but yes I’m concerned it might be too much. Planning on using all forms of transport. Will definitely have a look at khao yai and Erawan. Thank you 🙏

        Reply:2
        All forms of transportation is a bit vague. I suggest looking at 12go.asia and have a look at how long it takes to get from one island to the next. With your schedule you spend at least 2 weeks of your holiday on ferries and taxis.

Hello! I just came back from my 4 week thailand travel. I think its too many island, but you can be spontaneous. I would highly recommend Koh Phangan, my partner and I liked this island the most, because its full of nature and exploring things. I can also recommend "The Pier" you sleep in your own bungalow right next to the ocean (not the most beautiful beach, but a very nice feeling in my opinion) you can also rent scooters there for like 7€ per day, which makes the exploring way easier. We also did not like bangkok, 2 nights were enough for us, its very very busy. I personally did not see chang mai or generelly the north of thailand, but every local we talked to recommended us to go there. Hope this helps :)

    Reply:1
    Thank you so much - this is so helpful. Would you mind sharing your itinerary?

        Reply:2
        sure! we started at bangkok and stayed two nights. Then we went to Hua Hin, but this was just because we travelled low budget and did not want to take a flight, was not that beautiful so i would not recommend it (stayed there 3 nights). After that we went to Krabi and stayed there over a week because I had to go to the hospital. I  can recommend the COSI Hotel 10€ per night per person, they have a rooftop pool, you can do your laundry there and the rooms are beautiful for this price. After this we went to Koh Phi Phi. We did not like it there, its full with tourists and a very small island, you can do great snorkeltrips there but thats it (in my opinion). Then we went to Koh Phangan for 1 week. Then to Koh Samui for 5 nights, but this was also very touristic in comparison to koh phangan. Then we took a flight to bangkok and stayed there 2 nights, because our flight home went from bangkok. We also heard only good things from Koh Tao! But did not make it because I was Ill for a week. I wisj you a great time in Thailand and be aware of scams in bangkok!

                Ko Tao is the best island in Thailand. Defo make space for it. 

My Thailand itinerary last April was a bit stupid though, far too much travelling and some places weren't the best. I didn't like Koh Lanta personally, found it deathly quiet without much to do apart from the national park.

Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Krabi, Phuket, Ko Phi Phi, Ko Lanta, Ko Samui, Ko Phangan, Ko Tao, Krabi fly Chiang Mai (purely for price of flights from Ko Samui v. Boat and flight from Krabi).

                    Reply:5
                    Thank you so much! Have heard amazing things about koh Tao so we definitely going there. We will be diving too. I’m going to cut out some places as I now realise it’s too much travelling.

                        It's doable, but it's almost doable for doables sake.

Chiang Mai/Pai/Rai is certainly doable in a week or 9 days. 

Bangkok, probably a 2 night jobby - it's not my favourite city if I'm honest. 

Ko Samui/Phangan/Tao are relatively close together and you can spend 9 days or 3 weeks there depending on how much you like it.

Krabi is quite nice, Railay is only 20 mins from Ao Nang and you can have a day trip there without missing much - although the sunset there is stunning.

That seem like a lot of different islands, and an island is an island... From what I know the first route is wacky, like going from Pha Ngan to the "Trat" islands is not ideal, so it's either the Krabi and down there island, or the around Trat ones.

1st: If you do the "Trat" ones you can hop to Cambodia for Angkor Wats (best temple complexe you'll see in Asia or even in the world IMO) and arguably better islands (or what used to be ?) away from Sihanoukville (I loved North Koh Ta Kiev, felt like Thailand before the 00's with bambou huts and no electricity), really liked Koh Rong too, but it was turned into a chinese casino disaster I heard ? I loved Koh Chang but it got very "russian"/build up now, didn't do the smaller ones, heard tales of sandflies and those monsters like me too much to even try...

Alternative route for 1st: start from Chiang Mai, than from Chiang Rai go to Luang Prabang in Laos on a Mekong 2 days "cruise", Luang Prabang (and Laos in general) is amazing, than continue down to Vientiane via Vang Vieng, and from there to the Trat region (make a stop in Angkor "on the way") to end up by the relaxing beaches after all the visiting. (and like that you avoid unnecessary planes rides)

2nd: If you go south, you have to take into consideration that some islands are bigger with stuff to see on it, and other are just island life. Tao have great restaurants and Padi training but not much else (lot of shallow waters beaches). Pha Ngan is part too family friendly/ part too party vibe, and beware of the life ruining sandflies ! On the other side I didn't like Lanta that much (large beaches with no shades lined with restaurants/hotels, some nice "untouched" one to the south but not crazy beautiful), great food tho. I liked Pipi even if very crowded in the day time with tours, my personal favorite was tiny Kradan, the most beautiful paradise type views I had in all around Thailand, but the food is not great (at least for the thai, it's mostly italian) and accommodation is expensive for what you get (used to have cheap bungalows far north but they closed during the pandemic from what I know). And controversial but I didn't care for Krabi...

For the north I really liked going after Pai to the Myanmar border, to Mae Hong Song, but I had a lot of time.

Great site for infos [Travelfish.org](http://Travelfish.org)

Have a great trip !!

    Reply:1
    Wow thank you so much, this is so helpful and has really made me rule out my 1st itinerary as we unfortunately have to start our route in Krabi as spending a week there with family for Christmas until we off on our own. From northern Thailand we actually going to Laos as we travelling in total for 3.5 months. Will look at kraden and thinking of skipping lanta and lipe now then continuing with the 2nd itinerary.

        Reply:2
        Oh that's great ! In Laos I really liked the tiny village of Muang Ngoi Neua, only accessible by boat but with great food and bungalows in lush gardens on the river, the views on the mountains from your hammock are to die for, with tiny wooden villages on rice fields in close distance, I heard they got a road now tho, and probably changed a bit...

If it's your first trip there: be carful with your bags in thai buses, don't let anything of value in your big checked ones and lock them up, they get looked into during the trip pretty often, even - especially - on luxury bus companies, by the "helpers"

But it's just amazing, easy to travel, cheap, people are fantastic (as long as you respect them), beautiful architecture and sceneries, incredible food, you're going to love it so much ! Enjoy !

            Sounds great and thanks for the advice will definitely be keeping this all in mind. Very excited!

I would pick 2 islands (3 at most) so you can actually enjoy each place you go.  It is exhausting to pack travel, unpack, pack travel, etc.  With only 48 hours or so in each place.


What is it you hope to get our of this trip?  History, relaxation, culture, excitement.  That will determine where to go.  Thailand is an amazing country.


One suggestion if it's your first time in SE Asia:  from Bangkok fly into Siem Reap one morning and see Angkor Wat.  Stay 1 night, see more of the temples and fly back that evening to Bangkok or another location.

    Thank you! Yes we are hoping to enjoy the culture, nature, history and have some moments of relaxing. We also enjoy diving. I think you right in terms of cutting the islands down

Burning season is fine, I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you have major respiratory issues, in which case you shouldn't be travelling to SEA anyways. That said, you could consider going to Koh Samui or Koh Tao instead, just to see a different side of the island culture.

    Reply:1
    Thank you for this. When you say different side of island culture, can you elaborate on what you mean please? Would it really feel different to Krabi? (which I appreciate is technically mainland not island)

        Reply:2
        I don't think it would feel super different, but it depends on what/where you book. It's just another place to see, it wouldn't necessarily be a drastic difference. Krabi itself is very textured and has everything from partying, to national parks, to isolated resort life, so you need to choose your own adventure here. The Koh Samui - Koh Tao chain of islands is similar, there's a lot of choice in what your experience could be. Partying, diving, quiet resorts, nature, etc. 

If you want a drastic difference, you might want to consider Malaysia, it seems to be a very common option for people making their way to Krabi — I haven't done Malaysia though, personally.

        They can, but we stayed in Tonsai for like 4 days after planning on it being only 1 night and enjoyed it as a chill out spot in the middle of our trip. It's a lot slower and feels like you're on an island.

I had the same thing last March, idea was to go Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket (as was meeting friends who were flying in from Oz and UK).

Instead I went to Krabi after Bangkok and then went to Chiang Mai a few months later in May. 

If you can do it, I would prefer Vietnam over Cambodia in every way however for 4 days, it might be good to pop over to Siem Reap and see Angkor Wat.

    Reply:1
    Considered Siem Reap, but also hearing how March is too hot for it so not sure!

  
Where in Vietnam would you recommend?

        Reply:2
        Vietnam's my favourite country in the world, so it's pretty much an open book. I think North Vietnam is the most spectacular scenery I've seen, particularly Sapa and Ha Giang. Hanoi is a fantastic city as well. The issue is it's 6 hours drive from Hanoi to Sapa, so if you have 4 days then it's probably not going to be worth the visit.

SEA is hot generally in March, and Cambodia rarely gets cold in that time of year, but for 4 days I think it's worth doing that visit, as it is a stunning place - and I'm not generally a fan of Cambodia.

            Reply:3
            Thanks. Have you also done da nang with hue and Hoi an? How does that compare with Hanoi?

                Reply:4
                Hoi an is a lovely town, with a beautiful river and is quite a relaxing place compared to Hanoi. The old town is very easily one of the more chilled out spots I've seen in Vietnam.

Da Nang I only spent an evening in because I was flying out the next day. Went to Asia Asia park at night and was one of about 10 people in a theme park. Felt like a Scooby Doo character. 

Hue I'd love to actually properly visit, but apart from telling you I bought a coffee in between buses which was very nice, I can't say much other than what I've seen on TV.

In Phuket, the Amari Phuket or the Hyatt Regency Phuket are great. In Punta Cana, check out the Iberostar Grand Bávaro or the Excellence Punta Cana. Low chance of rain and generally sunny and pleasant temperatures in both places 

Cancun and Jamaica (Negril or Montego Bay) could be great alternatives

Choose Phuket if you want a richer cultural experience and are interested in exploring local life and natural landscapes beyond just the beach. It offers more variety in activities and sightseeing.
Choose Punta Cana if your main goal is a classic beach resort experience where you can relax in luxury without worrying about additional costs

Thailand better, safer ect. I’d never go back to dominican . Hustled and scammed until i was watching my back just to get out of there. Rented a car that was stolen from me. Offered to have a beer at this guys bar. I was nice enough to buy him and his friend a beer then came the extremely high bill. Yeah. Had to deal with police after vehicle was stolen no thanks. I go in vacation for peace not to have my nerve racked. Taxi driver scammed to. Always ask price from point to point . Just cause he gave you a good price on the first trip dont assume. Thailand hand down never had a issue there.  Always have people running up to you trying to get money no peace. If you go stay in a resort. Cause when you go out the coming. If you go better have your antennas working to catch the bs.

What part of the island are you looking? Perhaps could find some local spots for you. Just google for best local food in Koh Samui and you definitely will catch the hotspots, e.g.: https://www.eatingthaifood.com/restaurants/thai-food-in-koh-samui/ or https://phanganist.com/koh-samui-travel-guide-eat-drink-restaurant-article/koh-samui-thai-food-guide ofcourse you can go for something higher end like https://fanclubthailand.co.uk/11-of-the-best-places-to-eat-on-ko-samui/

Thank you for those links I’ll have a look. I’ve been looking at more of the resorts, there was a TUI Blue and a Sheraton that kept popping up but still indecisive as to the actual hotel location on the island as I’m not sure where the best spots are atm. I will be booking it by the end of this week hopefully. If you have any recommendations on locations please send them over I would be extremely grateful! Thanks!

New Zealand, Australia, Fiji or Papau New Guinea, Maldives. Places in the world that are expensive to get to.

    Reply:1
    I wouldn't put Papua New Guinea on the same list as the others. 

The rest, pretty much anyone would enjoy, or could find something cool to do. PNG is kind of a dump in the urban areas, and the rural areas, while beautiful, are difficult and/or expensive to get to.

    Reply:1
    To add to this, once you pick one of these, you can do multiple quite cheaply. Flights to or from Australia and New Zealand are usually pretty low. You can use Fiji as a layover destination (or Tahiti) if you're flying from North America. If not, Fiji is a 4 hour flight from Auckland. Flights to Bali, Indonesia are cheap if you fly out of many big airports in Australia. Thailand is cheap to get to as well. Vanuatu would likely be memorable and is a less known destination, but it's right in the area. 

New Zealand has incredible nature. They have glow worms. They have a good recognition of the Maori culture that's definitely worth checking out. They have Milford sound. They have some of the clearest night skies in the world on the south island. Australia has the Great Barrier Reef, but it's dying. If you want to see it, there's not going to be a better time. They have a rainforest. Animals you're not going to see in the wild anywhere else. There's also ways to discount travel in these countries as well. Both have an active transfercar network, allowing rental cars in some instances to be rented for almost nothing (I rented one for 2 days in NZ through this website. With full insurance, it was $60 for both days combined). In Queensland, Australia, you can get a rail pass to use the trains going one way or all ways for one or two moths; $300 or $400 depending on the ticket. It comes with unlimited stops. You could see a shit ton of the East Coast and even into the outback if you wanted to for that cost.

If you’re looking for a “trip of a lifetime”-tier place, I think Patagonia should be high on your list. It’s a huge region spanning southern Chile and Argentina. Fly into Santiago, take a couple days to check it out (great nightlife scene here), hop down to Bariloche for a few days, and then head down to the main attractions like Torres del Paine, Perito Moreno, and Fitz Roy. If you’re feeling really crazy, head down to Terra del Fuego province and book a boat to take you to Antarctica — because you’ll likely never be closer! 

Chile and Argentina have interesting cultures and some of the most impressive nature I’ve ever seen. The seasons are flipped from ours in the northern hemisphere, so if you live somewhere with nasty winter weather this might be a welcome break. Unique animal life in Patagonia like ñandú (like an emu), penguins, and guanacos (like a llama). Plan to rent a car once you’re down in Patagonia and just have a blast. One of the best trips I’ve ever done.

Southern Spain, Andalusia. Sevilla, and Granada. You'd be hard pressed to spend $7k on flights and hotels though, even the best hotels are like $300/night. The cost of living there is very low but it's the best place in the world to me.

Maybe go to Italy on the $7k budget and save Spain for when you're paying your own way. Italy is wonderful too, but you pay for the nicer accommodations there.

If you liked deep sea fishing in Cabo, similar but mind blowing experiences would be taking a private snorkeling (or fishing whichever you prefer) tour in Belize. + 1 you could learn how to dive in the coolest place on earth. If seafood is your thing, Belize has some of the freshest including restaurants. 

Partying with the locals? Sort of in a rubbing elbows, organically happens way? Not a forced Airbnb experience of partying with the locals? Easily Medellin Colombia. Yes Provenza and Poblado are fun and all they’re hyped up to be but, I highly recommend La 70 for a super authentic experience. This is where life happens + 1 if you can go to a Nacional or DME game. The streets around the stadium are full of life and locals. Take a helicopter over the Piedra de Peñol and spend the night  glamping in Guatape. Stroll through the town and learn about silleteros sit in the plaza and take life in. While we are on the topic of Colombia, go ride a Willy in Salento and enjoy all the colorful streets. Take a horse through the coffee fields and have a cup of Joe with your tour guide (hola Don. Luis).  PLAY TEJO. This is where you will party with the locals (and tourists!) doing the most traditional FUN AND I MEAN FUN game in the world. Head over to Cartagena, but discover the streets of Getsemani. Take a boat tour to the Islas of Rosario!!! Look at Jade. Marvel at all of the beauty (and strong character) of Cartagena at night. Bonus adventure: San Andres Island. The water is worth it. Go as bougieeee as you wish with your hotels here or as humble. It’s the right country for both. 

Eat pizza on the Pacaya Volcano with chef David before he becomes way too famous! You can hike or horseback up to the volcano? Slide down a volcano in Leon, then take the party bus back into town. Fun fun experience. Drink and dance at a floating water bar (Bitcoin!) in the middle of the most beautiful blue water on Big Corn Island in Nicaragua. Stay at Yemaya Little Corm if you feel up to it. It gives Maldives on a budget vibes. Still fairly raw and untainted. 

Visit the temples of Bali. 

Chase waterfalls in Iceland and Faroe Islands. I highly recommend getting lost here - rent a car and get off the beaten path. See the northern lights. Go behind water falls at the Faroe Islands. Seek your own smaller waterfalls. 

Go party in the streets of puerto Escondido. 

Puerto Rico, La Plácita de Santurce to party with the locals. Reggaeton blasting from every possible angle. Drinks are good, food is cheap. 

Wake up early and go watch the monks and dogs interact in the temples of Bangkok right before the madness starts and the world roars. Take the water taxi down and absorb all the temples. Stay at the Penninsula, ball on a budget or go all out on luxury. 

Go to Kuala Lumpur and take in all of the sky scrapers and culture. Eat Dim Sum in Hong Kong, then hit a rooftop bar or lounge. Immerse yourself in the culture. 

Walk the Sydney bridge, spoil yourself in Sydney, take selfies with quokka in Perth. Go see the Great Barrier Reef, or don’t. But what an amazing decision to have to make. 

Have fun and keep us posted on what you decide on.

    Damn, thanks a ton for this. 

It's scary and exciting that I haven't heard of the majority of the places you've mentioned. We've been exclusively in Asia and Europe, looking to broaden our horizons and you've given us a great place to start. Thanks, again!

While Colombia is on our places to travel, I think we're deciding on a 2 week excursion in Tanzania. We're in the process of talking to several tour groups to help us through the planning. There's so much to do! We're usually pretty chill about our plans, but we're definitely breaking out the spreadsheets for this one.

Echoing everyone here- give yourself the gift of a luxury safari. For more variety (which you’ll want… safaris are a lot of sitting) look up Tanzania. Some of the best wildlife viewing in the world, Zanzibar for culture/food/diving and Arusha (I haven’t been there, but have heard good reviews for culture experiences as well).

    Reply:1
    I second the Safari - it’s truly the most amazing feeling to see a pride of lions eating a giraffe, the great migration with wildebeest risking croc attacks to cross the water, hippos snorting in the river nearby, and elephants plodding along to the water hole . Africa has the most jaw dropping sunsets and scenery, and a sense of calm in bush that you won’t find elsewhere. It was supposed to be a once in a lifetime trip , and now it’s every year or two we go . So addictive. 

I liked Tanzania , and Kenya, but my favourite is South Africa ( Kruger more than Kalahari ) .

Great honeymoon destination!

I would recommend a mix of adventure destinations and relaxing areas.

Phuket could be a good base, but I'm personally not a huge fan of the area - quite touristy, but the comfort in that might suit!

You could use Phuket as a base (probably where you'll find the best street food, after Bangkok), and depending on how long you have, you could visit:
- Khao Sok national park
- Koh Lanta (very relaxing beachy island)
- Koh Tao (beachy, but more touristy)
If I could only pick one, I'd stay at a nice villa in Koh Tao and alternate between relaxing days at beach bars and slightly more adventurous walks or trips to other beaches.

For cash, check your bank/card fees for ATM and international transactions. Most likely outcome is you'll be best to take out a lot of cash at a good international ATM (they usually let you take the most out). You can do this at the airport when you also get a Sim card.

For the electrical plugs, generally the US plug is accepted. Some places may only have a EU style plug, so perhaps consider bringing a converter. Be sure to check any chargers you bring are rated to 220V, since US is 110V (though most products can handle 110-240V.

Hope this helps!

If you’ve never left the US, Phuket is a great start. Yes, it’s touristy for Thailand, but way less touristy than Cancun. Lots of great hotels and resorts right on the beach, INCREDIBLE food, nice people. Don’t stay in Patong, it’s kinda gross, but good to go there for a night for food market. There are ATM’s all over the place. There’s a cash exchange place in the old town right around the corner from the Sunday night market that has great rates (never change money at the airport). There are a lot of night markets, some have different vibes but generally sell the same stuff. There’s a super fancy designer mall (LV, Gucci, etc) in Phuket if you want something high end. There are so many incredible day trips you can take. If you stay somewhere other than the old town and Patong, it’s not overrun by tourists and you can have a really good time. Enjoy!

Phuket is very touristy. If you wanna go where the locals go, try Hua Hin. If you’re looking to splurge - Naka Island. 

ICONSIAM for shopping, but honestly, there are tons of malls in Bangkok. If you’re looking for clothes, try Platinum Fashion Mall. Chinatown has some great street food, but honestly, just about anywhere is good. 

I just bring cash (get newer $100 bills as Thai banks exchange places won’t accept old ones). You get a better exchange rate exchanging $100s vs $20s. Use a credit card that doesn’t haven’t foreign transaction fees, but be prepared to mostly pay w/ cash if you’re not in malls, hotels, or major food chains. Also use Superrich Money Exchange away from the airport. They generally have the best rates. 

As for phone chargers, they have regular outlets like the US. I had no issues. 

Sorry for the long post. I love Thailand. Planning on retiring there. It also helps my girlfriend is Thai 🤣🤣

For an American who’s never been abroad, Phuket (and Bangkok) are ideal. Phuket has a tourist path paved. Restaurants will have English menus. (You can also search for local food.) Hotels and tour guides speak English, to answer your questions. Plenty of adventure but easy to navigate.

A lot of hotels have universal outlets now so any plug shape works. (Note there’s a difference between having the right prong shape and having the right voltage.) Also, a lot of hotels have adapters you can borrow. Email the hotel in advance to ask for a picture of their outlets, if you want to be sure.

Advice on food. Tourist restaurants modify the flavors and spiciness levels toward a western palate. I prefer local food. I look for a no-frills restaurant (no aesthetic vibes), but with a few Thai customers. Our best meal last time was at outdoor restaurant stalls with plastic stools/tables, open-air but under a tin roof. Shanty vibes but the food was amazing (and genuinely spicy!).

We liked Phuket and stayed at 5 star Hotel called Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.  In May 2017, we paid about $110 a night.  I just looked and current May 2025 rates that include their huge buffet breakfast start about $135USD.  We had pre-arranged for the hotel to pick us up at airport for about $40 for the 40-45 minute ride to the hotel, but you might hire a Grab taxi for less; download the Grab app.
The property is beautiful and surrounded by lush mountains that extend into the water on each side so the beachfront is private.  There is a grill and bar near the beach for food and drinks too.  Besides the fantastic buffet breakfast in their main dining area, there are several other restaurants on the property.  One restaurant is located on an area that extends into center of the pool area; this has a buffet dinner and music entertainment for a reasonable fee.  We used ATMs I think to get Thai baht or we exchanged our cash at the hotel front desk.  Take newer date clean crisp  bills as their banks are picky, so some vendors won’t take US bills with any folds or marks on them.  
We took a cheap taxi into nearby town to do some touristy shopping and were told their nightlife there was lively but we aren’t into drinking/partying so we left before dark.  There are several local food places to eat at too.  The hotel can probably help you arrange tours to see the Thai sites or go to different nearby beaches or towns.  We were only there 2.5 days after our son’s wedding and we so enjoyed staying at the Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.

Another place we absolutely LOVE is Hoi An, Vietnam!  Plan to stay minimum of 4 days here.  It is great and sooo inexpensive and enchanting with all the lanterns that they are known for!  To get to Hoi An, fly to DaNang (see Dragon bridge and Hands bridge while there).  If you have time, do both Bangkok, Thailand and Hoi An, Vietnam while you are over there since flights between areas of Asia are very reasonable with Vietnam Airlines or Viet Jet. March and first part of December is good time to go to Hoi An for best weather but this place is beautiful all year and much to do.  Fall is their wet monsoon season so plan accordingly.
We stayed at Bel Marina Resort there recently (for 2nd time) which is located on a river for $94/night includes huge buffet breakfast; excellent service and accommodations.  Be sure to tell them it is your honeymoon ahead of time and you’ll likely get a free room upgrade.  Tell them Cynthia and Charles Petri sent you!  It was our 50th Anniversary and they gave us free upgrade and other special things.  Our “king” bed was size of two full size beds together; and had a balcony facing the pool.  It is a 5 minute walk or take a complimentary hotel bike to old town Hoi An for great local food (Bahn Mi sandwich rolls, Cao Lau, and Chicken Rice and spring rolls) and neat local crafts shopping (lanterns, custom leather goods, tailor shops, pop-up greeting cards at $1.40 each, Lulemon crossbody bag knock-offs for $5, silk sewn pictures, and beautiful abilone/shell decorated trivets and trays ($3 for 7” size trivet) for example. All shopping is negotiable!  
Be sure to book an evening boat cruise (light dinner with 2 cocktails) from the Bel Marina  included setting out a floating wish candle.  
We also recommend going to see the excellent Hoi An Memories Show (about $40-45 a person) across the Moon bridge (hotel can arrange it), which features a large outdoor beautiful production story about Hoi An’s beginnings with about 400 actors and special lights and effects.  Several free Mini pre-show performances begin about 5pm on different areas of the entertainment grounds so go early if you want to see these performances before the 7pm main show.  
Book a tour at the Silk Village to see the hands-on silk worm growing and processing to make silk fabric; so interesting.  
You’ll see gold-colored fancy covered golf cart taxis called ‘Hoi An Go’ around town.  For $20/person, you can book a 3 hour city/area tour.  They are a cheap taxi for getting around town too if you are tired of walking.  The city tour will include a stop at the round coconut boat rides which you must do and will drive through the rice fields with the water buffaloes.  We chose a shorter 45 minute ride on one round coconut boat for about $6-7USD/person, but think you can get cheaper price with negotiating when you show them cheaper pricing online, ha!
Be sure to visit the day markets and night markets there.  Lots of cheap local food and drinks in Hoi An all along the river next to old town Hoi An and on nearby parallel streets.  Lots of foot and body massage places too, very cheap. Bel Marina also offers spa services at reasonable prices.  Their restaurant on site has reasonable food prices too for lunch/dinner too.  
The hotel also has a scheduled free shuttle to the nearby beach, but their pool is huge.  They own the property next door too which has a roof top infinity pool with great views.  Just do it!!
We had no problem using our Apple chargers in their outlets in VN or Thailand, but if concerned, you can buy a travel converter for not too much.  Tipping is not customary or expected in VN or Thailand but is much appreciated if you do and if you return to a place, they give special service. Only tip $1 or 2.  
If you have the time and your dates are flexible, you could book a reasonable transpacific repositioning cruise to Asia (about 14-21 days) from Seattle/Vancouver, CA or vice versa in late Fall or Spring to get you over to Asia.  From there, you can catch a reasonable flight to where you want to go in Asia.  Flights will be your biggest cost unless you don’t mind economy.  Use Google flights to put a saved watch to where you want to go.  I’ve seen economy flights in economy for under $600 pop-up for one-way from Houston to Vietnam.  Use vacationstogo.com to find cheap cruises if that interests you.

First, congratulations to your wedding 

Then:
From woman to woman:
Stay away from the areas that have high prostitution, if you want to avoid your first heavy argument 🤣
Seriously, in some areas it’s nice and quiet and then for example if you go to Patong or Phuket mainstreet it’s horrible. 
I as a woman was harassed by women (?) in the Main Street of Phuket and in a party street in Bangkok. They can get quite aggressive for different reasons. Some even try to lure your man while you are standing next to them, others try to make money of you by pleasing you too 😆.

That’s the disclaimer. Apart from the high-prostitution areas it’s a very nice country to travel to. Enjoy!

Krabi is a good place. You can also do island hopping. Food are the best and not as crowded as other touristy place in Thailand.

Comment:
Phuket is super touristy but if you book outside of Patong, closer to the old city, there are some lovely beaches. The best street food in Thailand is in Bangkok and Chiang Mai (best food in general is up north) but the islands have no shortage of good restaurants. I’d recommend Krabi or Koh Lanta if you want to mostly have beach time with stunning views. If you want a mix of beach and excursions and activities, Phuket can be a good HQ, as there are day trips to all of the most popular things in the area that leave from there.

    How did you find Singapore and how many days did you go for? Would it be more of a city break?

        Reply:2
        Actually just got back on Monday. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would! It's the cleanest city I've ever been to (even more so than Tokyo) and feels extremely well designed. The public transportation is great and it's very pedestrian friendly. It's also very diverse which is reflected in the food, architecture and culture. 

I spent 2 days there and didn't get to see everything I wanted to - probably would've added 1 more day. I'd say that it's the perfect place go before or after your main destination - ie Thailand, Bali, etc. 

The worst thing about Singapore is the weather. It's extremely hot and humid year round. It feels oppressive and worse than any other place I've been to in Southeast Asia. That said, there's AC basically everywhere.

Do you have to fly in and out of Thailand from BKK? It would be a more efficient use of time to fly into Thailand BKK / DMK and out of Thailand HKT (Phuket). Or vice versa. Check the prices on seperate flight tickets or a multicity ticket instead of a return ticket. Even if it is a bit more, factor in the money you'd save by having one less domestic flight in Thailand.

    Yess, the direct flights are costing is way more

*Here updated ITINERARY 

5th Nov: Bangkok Arrival

Suggestion: If you have energy left, the Asiatique Riverfront is a unique night market on the river with great dining options.


6th Nov: Phuket Arrival & Night Markets

Markets: Try Chillva Market or Naka Market (Phuket Weekend Market) for local foods, clothes, and souvenirs.


7th Nov: Phuket Beaches & Bangla Road

Nightlife: Bangla Road is lively, but if you’d like a more relaxed evening option, Kata Noi has some nice beachfront bars.


8th Nov: Phi Phi Island and Nearby Beaches

Boat Tour: A full-day boat tour around Phi Phi might include snorkeling stops. Consider booking a sunrise tour to avoid crowds at iconic spots like Maya Bay.

    Loved your suggestions. We're for sure going to consider the Bangkok river cruise for our last day and visit terminal 21 if we've time. Do you think I'll be able to shop (big shopaholic) properly if i follow the above itenary?

Where are you flying from? Japan and Korea aren't that close to Thailand and Vietnam so you'll lose a day traveling getting between those countries. I would consider doing Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia or Myanmar. You can start and just do a circle clockwise or counter clockwise. I'd suggest (not knowing where you are coming from however) starting in Hanoi in northern Vietnam. A month goes by fast but some must see places in my opinion to research and consider depending on what you like: (I would chose a few from each)

Vietnam: Hanoi, Halong Bay, Sapa, Hoi An, Hue, Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City. 

Cambodia: Siem Reap (Angkor Wat is a must see), Phnom Penh, Battanbang, Lake Tonle Sap.

Thailand: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Ayutthaya, Ko Toh, Chiang Rai

Laos: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Nong Kiau, Luang Namtha, Wat Phu, Phonsavan

Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kuching, Pulau Perhentian, Melaka

Myanmar: Maymyo, Kyaiktiyo, Bagon, Ngapali, Inle Lake, Mandalay and Yangon

Everywhere is safe, and everywhere can be dangerous if your stumbling around drunk by yourself at 3am. 

Flights between places can be super cheap and some are only reached by bus/train. There are some amazing ways to get between places by boat on the Mekong where the 8 hours of travel are quite the experience on a long boat. 

My first trip to SE Asia I went for a month and only went to 3 countries and made 8 stops and I felt rushed but I like to try to spend a minimum of a few days in each place. Went back for 9 months and only went to 6 countries and was spending usually a week minimum in each stop. 

You know how you like to travel so figure out what works but rushing it over there can be very frustrating because things don't always work on time and the weather can be tricky. 

I've never been to Japan or Korea. 

I did go to the Philippines and Manila, and El Nido were incredible but I only went to those two places to meet up with a friend who was on tour there and it was a spur of the moment thing. 

Hope this helps a little. I'm jealous. Enjoy.

I would narrow it down to maybe 2-3 countries that are closer together. I did a 2 week trip to Thailand and Cambodia (ended up being more like 12 days on the ground after travel days). I wish I had had more time to just fully explore those two without hopping around every few days.

Given that, I think you can skip Bangkok and go straight to Chiang Mai or go down to Phuket and explore the islands from there. I know Cambodia wasn't listed but Angkor Wat was incredible and would highly highly recommend including in your itinerary.

Comment:
If Philippines: You don’t need to stay in Manila because traffic is bad and there’s not much to see (except Intramuros, I guess?) unless you want to go shopping and drinking.

You can go to the beach like Boracay or Palawan instead and If you have more time, the Mt. Province area is really nice but the travel time is crazy (12 hours one way) and can only be done by bus from the city.

There is really no reason to pick 4. Aaia is easy, safe and affordable to get around in. And why would you want to spend a week in Singapore? You know it's especially a city filled with Super Wealthy Chinese correct? Not much to do and very little true culture that will be shared with you; skip it. Try Cambodia, Taiwan or Malaysia instead.

Comment:
If I was living in Korea, I’d do Japan as a long weekend. Osaka is a short flight from Seoul (assuming you live there). 

If you’re going to SEA I think it would depend on budget and interest. Most of SEA is pretty safe if you’re a reasonably alert traveller. 

Singapore - would be the most expensive, but arguably the safest. City vibes mainly.

Thailand - huge diversity between the islands, Bangkok, and the hills of the north (Chiang Mai). It’s worth seeing all three.

Vietnam - covers a huge amount of territory vertically. South (Ho Chi Minh), central (Hoi An), north (Ha Noi), and super north (Sapa) all offer very different experiences and also worth experiencing all.

I’m least experienced with the Philippines so I won’t comment on that, but much of Indonesia is wonderful to explore too.

I would also throw in a suggestion for Cambodia if you’re willing (Myanmar is also excellent but more unpredictable these days.)

Fairly easy to visit Vietnam/Thailand in the same trip and cover a decent amount while stretching a budget.

Even for a first trip to Japan, you need like 2 weeks for the cities you played plus day trips, week and a half minimum for those 3 cities only.

Singapore isn't even a one day city, let alone one week. It's a layover city where you can pop out of the airport and have dinner somewhere and get a feel for Singaporean life. 

I don't know what you're doing for a week in those Filipino cities. Get out and be close to the water.

    Well I guess since we’re living in Korea even though we haven’t gone before we could go back to Japan on a long weekend after the first trip 🤔 

For a first trip where would we absolutely have to visit in Japan if you had to choose?

Right thinking to move Singapore to 2 days if we keep it on the list

        Japan is beautiful you could do the major places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa and be lost there forever. Also anywhere up north or going to Mount Fuji.

Singapore sucks. So much more to see in the other four with a week each.

That said, your plans are a lil too ambitious and most of your time will be spent traveling and not enjoying the location if your time is very tight and you have a strict 4 week limit. Consider cutting down the cities per country like Thailand could be Bangkok and Phuket and skip Chang Mai. Phillipines go to Palawan or a similar island instead of Manila. Maybe stop in Manila for a couple days only and then go to enjoy the beach

Switch out Philippines for Taiwan. Impossible to pick a bad city there. Just make sure you don’t stay in Taipei the whole time. I also love Tainan, Hualien, and Kaohsiung

    Honestly Taiwan slipped my brain and I’ll suggest it to my friend as a new option!

        Also, June/July is hot & rainy season in Philippines, so I agree with skipping it.

First of all, all those countries for just 1 month will be a rush and you wouldn't see much. You'll just be wasting a lot of time travelling on planes/buses/ferries...

Unless you only want to visit cities (which to me aren't that interesting for more than 2-3 days) I feel you'll be missing too much. You'd be better off picking 1 or two of those. 

You can easily spend a month in all those countries (other than Singapore - 2-3 days max is enough).

I'd decide what you want to do most. Beaches, history, sight seeing, nightlife... And then decide on just a couple of those. Otherwise if you try to fit too much in you'll maybe only get to visit 1-2 places per country. 

Personally I'd choose Japan or the Philippines. Never been to Japan but want to go, an dive spent 2 months island hopping the Philippines. 

You can do a lot of stuff yourself. I terms of getting around 12go.asia is good for booking buses/trains/ferries... 

If you are after just day tours - Klook, Get Your Guide and Viator are good for finding and booking stuff. But there will alos be others locally that could be cheaper that aren't on those apps.

    I think it would be easiest to visit Japan in the future so it would be best to focus on SE Asia which is a longer flight away but I’ll definitely discuss all the information I’ve received here with my friend! 

Thanks for the info on the taxi app 👏🏻

Sounds like an epic graduation celebration! To avoid burnout, I’d suggest sticking to 3-4 major stops. Start with Thailand (Bangkok and Phuket for the food and beaches), then head to Vietnam (maybe Hanoi for culture or Ho Chi Minh for energy). After that, visit your friend in Singapore, and if you’re up for it, stop in Taiwan (Taipei is super fun) before heading to Japan.

If you’re considering China, Hong Kong or Macau could be quick but fascinating stops. Check out this guide that helped me when I was traveling in China [https://gowithguide.com/China](https://gowithguide.com/China) Congrats on med school, and enjoy the adventure! 🎉

I’ve used an Airalo regional eSIM card for Asia a few times. It covers 18 countries. That might work for you

    It worked for us, just as advertised. Same in Europe too.

I'm so jealous! Regarding esims, I would recommend going with regional esim for this occasion. They are a bit more expensive, but less hassle. You can check this travel esim comparison [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/best_eSIM_providers/comments/1984tvl/best_esim_providers_comparison_table_for/) for different options.

Do you snorkel or dive? We snorkeled in the Surin islands (stayed in Khao Lak which is much closer to the departure than Phuket) and it was wonderful.

    Reply:1
    i do dive / snorkel - but not very often.

I live on an island so im familiar with the "sport"

        Reply:2
        Got it, no need to shift if that's not something you were looking for. Adventure, thrill, etc isn't super clear for what you want to do.

            Reply:3
            snorkeling does fit into the category - don't take me wrong - but i would probably not change my itinerary just for that.

maybe quads, ziplines, safari, kayak, rafting might be more towards what im looking for

If you're into "adventure, landscape, nature, thrill" then you can cut both Bangkok and Singapore down to a minimum or totally. Do a 5-day PADI dive course at Krabi. Personally I wouldn't bother with Singapore. There is none of those 4 things you want there IMO. Go visit the Golden Triangle or something in Thailand or do some treking.

    Reply:1
    Phuket too. Have a look on Travelfish. There are a dozen islands (many accessible from Krabi) more fitting for what you’re after in Thailand.

Comment:
You can easily visit Tiger Cave and the hot springs as a half-day trip from Krabi—there’s no need to spend the night there. I’d also suggest cutting down your time in Phuket unless partying is your priority; it’s a bit too touristy for my taste.

For accommodations in Krabi, consider Ao Nang or Noppharat Thara. Both are fantastic options and far better than staying in Krabi Town. From these spots, you can easily visit Railay and Tonsai Beach by canoe or a small boat. In general, Ao Nang makes an excellent base for exploring the nearby islands and attractions.

    by full day i meant a day trip - which probably takes 6-8 hours - im not staying for the night!

sorry for the confusion

        No problem. Enjoy Thailand.

Great review! Thanks for all the info.

If seats are available yes, if not. No. 

It's only a 6 hour flight or whatever, I'm sure you'll survive without the convo.

We've flown with Jetstar and many of the other LCCs internationally. We always end up sitting together.

Singapore. It is small and can be done in 2-3 days. Get some satay/laksa, visit marina bay, spend a day at sentosa, check out botanical gardens and gardens by the bay. Hit the hawker centers in Chinatown for Hainan Chicken Rice and visit some of the Hindu and Buddhist temples.

do not see the ping pong show.

Typically, yes. Usually the only thing you cannot change from what you put in at booking is your name. Everything else you put in can be updated, including your passport information.
