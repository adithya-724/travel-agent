            Some places are better. I don't think you could beat Bangkok and Change Mai.

Is there more of a seafood emphasis there?

Great honeymoon destination!

I would recommend a mix of adventure destinations and relaxing areas.

Phuket could be a good base, but I'm personally not a huge fan of the area - quite touristy, but the comfort in that might suit!

You could use Phuket as a base (probably where you'll find the best street food, after Bangkok), and depending on how long you have, you could visit:
- Khao Sok national park
- Koh Lanta (very relaxing beachy island)
- Koh Tao (beachy, but more touristy)
If I could only pick one, I'd stay at a nice villa in Koh Tao and alternate between relaxing days at beach bars and slightly more adventurous walks or trips to other beaches.

For cash, check your bank/card fees for ATM and international transactions. Most likely outcome is you'll be best to take out a lot of cash at a good international ATM (they usually let you take the most out). You can do this at the airport when you also get a Sim card.

For the electrical plugs, generally the US plug is accepted. Some places may only have a EU style plug, so perhaps consider bringing a converter. Be sure to check any chargers you bring are rated to 220V, since US is 110V (though most products can handle 110-240V.

Hope this helps!

If you’ve never left the US, Phuket is a great start. Yes, it’s touristy for Thailand, but way less touristy than Cancun. Lots of great hotels and resorts right on the beach, INCREDIBLE food, nice people. Don’t stay in Patong, it’s kinda gross, but good to go there for a night for food market. There are ATM’s all over the place. There’s a cash exchange place in the old town right around the corner from the Sunday night market that has great rates (never change money at the airport). There are a lot of night markets, some have different vibes but generally sell the same stuff. There’s a super fancy designer mall (LV, Gucci, etc) in Phuket if you want something high end. There are so many incredible day trips you can take. If you stay somewhere other than the old town and Patong, it’s not overrun by tourists and you can have a really good time. Enjoy!

Phuket is very touristy. If you wanna go where the locals go, try Hua Hin. If you’re looking to splurge - Naka Island. 

ICONSIAM for shopping, but honestly, there are tons of malls in Bangkok. If you’re looking for clothes, try Platinum Fashion Mall. Chinatown has some great street food, but honestly, just about anywhere is good. 

I just bring cash (get newer $100 bills as Thai banks exchange places won’t accept old ones). You get a better exchange rate exchanging $100s vs $20s. Use a credit card that doesn’t haven’t foreign transaction fees, but be prepared to mostly pay w/ cash if you’re not in malls, hotels, or major food chains. Also use Superrich Money Exchange away from the airport. They generally have the best rates. 

As for phone chargers, they have regular outlets like the US. I had no issues. 

Sorry for the long post. I love Thailand. Planning on retiring there. It also helps my girlfriend is Thai 🤣🤣

For an American who’s never been abroad, Phuket (and Bangkok) are ideal. Phuket has a tourist path paved. Restaurants will have English menus. (You can also search for local food.) Hotels and tour guides speak English, to answer your questions. Plenty of adventure but easy to navigate.

A lot of hotels have universal outlets now so any plug shape works. (Note there’s a difference between having the right prong shape and having the right voltage.) Also, a lot of hotels have adapters you can borrow. Email the hotel in advance to ask for a picture of their outlets, if you want to be sure.

Advice on food. Tourist restaurants modify the flavors and spiciness levels toward a western palate. I prefer local food. I look for a no-frills restaurant (no aesthetic vibes), but with a few Thai customers. Our best meal last time was at outdoor restaurant stalls with plastic stools/tables, open-air but under a tin roof. Shanty vibes but the food was amazing (and genuinely spicy!).

We liked Phuket and stayed at 5 star Hotel called Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.  In May 2017, we paid about $110 a night.  I just looked and current May 2025 rates that include their huge buffet breakfast start about $135USD.  We had pre-arranged for the hotel to pick us up at airport for about $40 for the 40-45 minute ride to the hotel, but you might hire a Grab taxi for less; download the Grab app.
The property is beautiful and surrounded by lush mountains that extend into the water on each side so the beachfront is private.  There is a grill and bar near the beach for food and drinks too.  Besides the fantastic buffet breakfast in their main dining area, there are several other restaurants on the property.  One restaurant is located on an area that extends into center of the pool area; this has a buffet dinner and music entertainment for a reasonable fee.  We used ATMs I think to get Thai baht or we exchanged our cash at the hotel front desk.  Take newer date clean crisp  bills as their banks are picky, so some vendors won’t take US bills with any folds or marks on them.  
We took a cheap taxi into nearby town to do some touristy shopping and were told their nightlife there was lively but we aren’t into drinking/partying so we left before dark.  There are several local food places to eat at too.  The hotel can probably help you arrange tours to see the Thai sites or go to different nearby beaches or towns.  We were only there 2.5 days after our son’s wedding and we so enjoyed staying at the Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.

Another place we absolutely LOVE is Hoi An, Vietnam!  Plan to stay minimum of 4 days here.  It is great and sooo inexpensive and enchanting with all the lanterns that they are known for!  To get to Hoi An, fly to DaNang (see Dragon bridge and Hands bridge while there).  If you have time, do both Bangkok, Thailand and Hoi An, Vietnam while you are over there since flights between areas of Asia are very reasonable with Vietnam Airlines or Viet Jet. March and first part of December is good time to go to Hoi An for best weather but this place is beautiful all year and much to do.  Fall is their wet monsoon season so plan accordingly.
We stayed at Bel Marina Resort there recently (for 2nd time) which is located on a river for $94/night includes huge buffet breakfast; excellent service and accommodations.  Be sure to tell them it is your honeymoon ahead of time and you’ll likely get a free room upgrade.  Tell them Cynthia and Charles Petri sent you!  It was our 50th Anniversary and they gave us free upgrade and other special things.  Our “king” bed was size of two full size beds together; and had a balcony facing the pool.  It is a 5 minute walk or take a complimentary hotel bike to old town Hoi An for great local food (Bahn Mi sandwich rolls, Cao Lau, and Chicken Rice and spring rolls) and neat local crafts shopping (lanterns, custom leather goods, tailor shops, pop-up greeting cards at $1.40 each, Lulemon crossbody bag knock-offs for $5, silk sewn pictures, and beautiful abilone/shell decorated trivets and trays ($3 for 7” size trivet) for example. All shopping is negotiable!  
Be sure to book an evening boat cruise (light dinner with 2 cocktails) from the Bel Marina  included setting out a floating wish candle.  
We also recommend going to see the excellent Hoi An Memories Show (about $40-45 a person) across the Moon bridge (hotel can arrange it), which features a large outdoor beautiful production story about Hoi An’s beginnings with about 400 actors and special lights and effects.  Several free Mini pre-show performances begin about 5pm on different areas of the entertainment grounds so go early if you want to see these performances before the 7pm main show.  
Book a tour at the Silk Village to see the hands-on silk worm growing and processing to make silk fabric; so interesting.  
You’ll see gold-colored fancy covered golf cart taxis called ‘Hoi An Go’ around town.  For $20/person, you can book a 3 hour city/area tour.  They are a cheap taxi for getting around town too if you are tired of walking.  The city tour will include a stop at the round coconut boat rides which you must do and will drive through the rice fields with the water buffaloes.  We chose a shorter 45 minute ride on one round coconut boat for about $6-7USD/person, but think you can get cheaper price with negotiating when you show them cheaper pricing online, ha!
Be sure to visit the day markets and night markets there.  Lots of cheap local food and drinks in Hoi An all along the river next to old town Hoi An and on nearby parallel streets.  Lots of foot and body massage places too, very cheap. Bel Marina also offers spa services at reasonable prices.  Their restaurant on site has reasonable food prices too for lunch/dinner too.  
The hotel also has a scheduled free shuttle to the nearby beach, but their pool is huge.  They own the property next door too which has a roof top infinity pool with great views.  Just do it!!
We had no problem using our Apple chargers in their outlets in VN or Thailand, but if concerned, you can buy a travel converter for not too much.  Tipping is not customary or expected in VN or Thailand but is much appreciated if you do and if you return to a place, they give special service. Only tip $1 or 2.  
If you have the time and your dates are flexible, you could book a reasonable transpacific repositioning cruise to Asia (about 14-21 days) from Seattle/Vancouver, CA or vice versa in late Fall or Spring to get you over to Asia.  From there, you can catch a reasonable flight to where you want to go in Asia.  Flights will be your biggest cost unless you don’t mind economy.  Use Google flights to put a saved watch to where you want to go.  I’ve seen economy flights in economy for under $600 pop-up for one-way from Houston to Vietnam.  Use vacationstogo.com to find cheap cruises if that interests you.

First, congratulations to your wedding 

Then:
From woman to woman:
Stay away from the areas that have high prostitution, if you want to avoid your first heavy argument 🤣
Seriously, in some areas it’s nice and quiet and then for example if you go to Patong or Phuket mainstreet it’s horrible. 
I as a woman was harassed by women (?) in the Main Street of Phuket and in a party street in Bangkok. They can get quite aggressive for different reasons. Some even try to lure your man while you are standing next to them, others try to make money of you by pleasing you too 😆.

That’s the disclaimer. Apart from the high-prostitution areas it’s a very nice country to travel to. Enjoy!

Krabi is a good place. You can also do island hopping. Food are the best and not as crowded as other touristy place in Thailand.

Comment:
Phuket is super touristy but if you book outside of Patong, closer to the old city, there are some lovely beaches. The best street food in Thailand is in Bangkok and Chiang Mai (best food in general is up north) but the islands have no shortage of good restaurants. I’d recommend Krabi or Koh Lanta if you want to mostly have beach time with stunning views. If you want a mix of beach and excursions and activities, Phuket can be a good HQ, as there are day trips to all of the most popular things in the area that leave from there.

I went to my honeymoon at Thailand. Love love love the country.
We spent few days at Phuket. Stayed on the Patong Beach area. Super lively area for drinks, walks & also have Jungceylon mall for shopping. Also did a day trip to Phi Phi islands. It was awesome.
Then we went to Krabi for 3-4 nights. We stayed on the Aonang Beach. Definitely not as lively as Phuket/Patong but it definitely is romantic and much serene. They also had great street food options. We did Railay bay and some other island hopping on one of those days.
Lastly, we stayed few days in Bangkok near Siam Square. Super lively city with loads of food options & shopping paradise. Since street food is a must - please try Raan Jay Fai’s Crab Omlette (it’s a Michelin starred street food & a must try)

Another vote for Koh Samui
My wife and I had our Honeymoon there a while ago. It’s more laid back than Phuket… 

Beautiful beaches, nice resorts and less crowded than Phuket. 

It’s not difficult to get to either, just another quick flight from Bangkok.

We loved it so much that we went back a few years later for several more days. 

If you have some extra time, I’d go visit Chiang Mai as well for a slightly different mountain / nature vibe.

None of Europe is tropical, and with the possible exception of the Canary Islands in a good year, I would consider none of it for a tropical beach vacation in December/January. 

I would also avoid Egypt, with everything going on in the neighboring countries at the moment.

Most of Asia is cheap and offers the tropical beaches you’re looking for. I would look into the “koh”’s in Thailand, Vietnam, and The Philippines. When opting for the Philippines, do check your government’s travel advice before booking, as not all of the Philippines is safe for travel.

Only warm places in Europe: Canary islands 
Cheap and warm places in Asia, that are close by to Berlin: Northern Cyprus
If you have a little more budget for a vacation in South-East-Asia: Bali isn't it. It may be warm there, but it's raining season + the beaches are NOT good. Visit some other places in Indonesia (there are plenty) or sabah in Malaysia/Borneo or Palawan in Philippines or Phuket in Thailand. Please check travel warnings from your countries foreign affairs office first before travelling & stay safe!

>I understand flights to Europe/Mediterranean are never cheap from US    

Your flight should typically be your cheapest cost. If you pay a bit more to travel, but you have a very cheap destination, it's a huge W.     

Some options off the top of my head where I've been that offer affordable accommodation and entertainment include Slovenia, Croatia, Vietnam, Turkiye (especially right now with the country in economic crisis) or a Balkans trip (Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania)

    Reply:1
    We definitely don't have affordable accommodations on the Croatian coast. Also, it's very cold and windy in December. It's not even nice to sit on the beach in your clothes, let alone swim

        I guess it depends on definition of "affordable" but yeah, point taken about the timing - I forgot OP was coming in December! Maybe not the med then :)

Do you have to fly in and out of Thailand from BKK? It would be a more efficient use of time to fly into Thailand BKK / DMK and out of Thailand HKT (Phuket). Or vice versa. Check the prices on seperate flight tickets or a multicity ticket instead of a return ticket. Even if it is a bit more, factor in the money you'd save by having one less domestic flight in Thailand.

    Yess, the direct flights are costing is way more

*Here updated ITINERARY 

5th Nov: Bangkok Arrival

Malls: Platinum Fashion Mall and December Mall are great for shopping. You could also consider Siam Paragon or Central world for a wider variety of stores.

Suggestion: If you have energy left, the Asiatique Riverfront is a unique night market on the river with great dining options.


6th Nov: Phuket Arrival & Night Markets

Markets: Try Chillva Market or Naka Market (Phuket Weekend Market) for local foods, clothes, and souvenirs.


7th Nov: Phuket Beaches & Bangla Road

Beaches: Beyond the main Patong Beach, consider Kata Beach or Karon Beach for a quieter vibe and scenic spots.

Nightlife: Bangla Road is lively, but if you’d like a more relaxed evening option, Kata Noi has some nice beachfront bars.


8th Nov: Phi Phi Island and Nearby Beaches

Boat Tour: A full-day boat tour around Phi Phi might include snorkeling stops. Consider booking a sunrise tour to avoid crowds at iconic spots like Maya Bay.


9th Nov: Old Phuket Town and Weekend Market

Old Phuket Town: Be sure to check out the vibrant Sino-Portuguese architecture and try some local cafés for a brunch experience.

Market: The Sunday Walking Street Market is very popular, with a variety of food and crafts.


10th Nov: Krabi Arrival

Markets: The Ao Nang Night Market offers a great range of local food options. Consider exploring Krabi Town Walking Street as well.


11th Nov: Railay Beach Day

Railay: The beach here is stunning. Besides relaxing, you can hike up to Railay Viewpoint if you’re up for it or explore Phra Nang Cave Beach nearby.


12th Nov: 7-Island Hopping Tour

Tour Options: Sunset tours are indeed less crowded. Most will include Poda Island, Chicken Island, and Phra Nang Cave Beach. Be sure to bring snorkeling gear or check with the tour operator for rentals.


13th Nov: Return to Bangkok + Shopping

Tofu Mall & Pratunam Market: Great choices for shopping, and you could also add MBK Center or Terminal 21 for more unique finds.


14th Nov: Shopping Day in Bangkok

Additional Option: You might want to consider Chatuchak Market if you're interested in a large selection of unique items, but it’s only open on weekends.



---

Additional Suggestions

Island Hopping (Alternative): If you want another unique island experience, Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai are beautiful and less crowded options near Phuket and Krabi.

Bangkok River Cruise: For a unique last night in Bangkok, you might enjoy a short river cruise with dinner along the Chao Phraya River.

    Reply:1
    Loved your suggestions. We're for sure going to consider the Bangkok river cruise for our last day and visit terminal 21 if we've time. Do you think I'll be able to shop (big shopaholic) properly if i follow the above itenary?

Where are you flying from? Japan and Korea aren't that close to Thailand and Vietnam so you'll lose a day traveling getting between those countries. I would consider doing Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia or Myanmar. You can start and just do a circle clockwise or counter clockwise. I'd suggest (not knowing where you are coming from however) starting in Hanoi in northern Vietnam. A month goes by fast but some must see places in my opinion to research and consider depending on what you like: (I would chose a few from each)

Vietnam: Hanoi, Halong Bay, Sapa, Hoi An, Hue, Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City. 

Cambodia: Siem Reap (Angkor Wat is a must see), Phnom Penh, Battanbang, Lake Tonle Sap.

Thailand: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Ayutthaya, Ko Toh, Chiang Rai

Laos: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Nong Kiau, Luang Namtha, Wat Phu, Phonsavan

Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kuching, Pulau Perhentian, Melaka

Myanmar: Maymyo, Kyaiktiyo, Bagon, Ngapali, Inle Lake, Mandalay and Yangon

Everywhere is safe, and everywhere can be dangerous if your stumbling around drunk by yourself at 3am. 

Flights between places can be super cheap and some are only reached by bus/train. There are some amazing ways to get between places by boat on the Mekong where the 8 hours of travel are quite the experience on a long boat. 

My first trip to SE Asia I went for a month and only went to 3 countries and made 8 stops and I felt rushed but I like to try to spend a minimum of a few days in each place. Went back for 9 months and only went to 6 countries and was spending usually a week minimum in each stop. 

You know how you like to travel so figure out what works but rushing it over there can be very frustrating because things don't always work on time and the weather can be tricky. 

I've never been to Japan or Korea. 

I did go to the Philippines and Manila, and El Nido were incredible but I only went to those two places to meet up with a friend who was on tour there and it was a spur of the moment thing. 

Hope this helps a little. I'm jealous. Enjoy.

I would narrow it down to maybe 2-3 countries that are closer together. I did a 2 week trip to Thailand and Cambodia (ended up being more like 12 days on the ground after travel days). I wish I had had more time to just fully explore those two without hopping around every few days.

Given that, I think you can skip Bangkok and go straight to Chiang Mai or go down to Phuket and explore the islands from there. I know Cambodia wasn't listed but Angkor Wat was incredible and would highly highly recommend including in your itinerary.

Comment:
If Philippines: You don’t need to stay in Manila because traffic is bad and there’s not much to see (except Intramuros, I guess?) unless you want to go shopping and drinking.

You can go to the beach like Boracay or Palawan instead and If you have more time, the Mt. Province area is really nice but the travel time is crazy (12 hours one way) and can only be done by bus from the city.

There is really no reason to pick 4. Aaia is easy, safe and affordable to get around in. And why would you want to spend a week in Singapore?

Try Cambodia, Taiwan or Malaysia instead.

If you’re going to SEA I think it would depend on budget and interest. Most of SEA is pretty safe if you’re a reasonably alert traveller. 

Singapore - would be the most expensive, but arguably the safest. City vibes mainly.

Thailand - huge diversity between the islands, Bangkok, and the hills of the north (Chiang Mai). It’s worth seeing all three.

Vietnam - covers a huge amount of territory vertically. South (Ho Chi Minh), central (Hoi An), north (Ha Noi), and super north (Sapa) all offer very different experiences and also worth experiencing all.

I’m least experienced with the Philippines so I won’t comment on that, but much of Indonesia is wonderful to explore too.

I would also throw in a suggestion for Cambodia if you’re willing (Myanmar is also excellent but more unpredictable these days.)

Fairly easy to visit Vietnam/Thailand in the same trip and cover a decent amount while stretching a budget.

My boyfriends mom is in Thailand for the next month or so. The photos shes posts from there are AMAZING and there's SO many things to do there, which is why she's spending a whole month in thailand. She was in vietnam for a bit in ho chi minh city and said she hasn't felt unsafe as a single woman travelling alone in vietnam or thailand but still have to be careful!

    Thanks for the insight 👏🏻 I’m starting to think of focusing more on Vietnam and Thailand

Even for a first trip to Japan, you need like 2 weeks for the cities you played plus day trips, week and a half minimum for those 3 cities only.

Singapore isn't even a one day city, let alone one week. It's a layover city where you can pop out of the airport and have dinner somewhere and get a feel for Singaporean life. 

I don't know what you're doing for a week in those Filipino cities. Get out and be close to the water.

    Reply:1
    Well I guess since we’re living in Korea even though we haven’t gone before we could go back to Japan on a long weekend after the first trip 🤔 

For a first trip where would we absolutely have to visit in Japan if you had to choose?

Right thinking to move Singapore to 2 days if we keep it on the list

        Japan is beautiful you could do the major places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa and be lost there forever. Also anywhere up north or going to Mount Fuji.

Singapore sucks. So much more to see in the other four with a week each.

That said, your plans are a lil too ambitious and most of your time will be spent traveling and not enjoying the location if your time is very tight and you have a strict 4 week limit. Consider cutting down the cities per country like Thailand could be Bangkok and Phuket and skip Chang Mai. Phillipines go to Palawan or a similar island instead of Manila. Maybe stop in Manila for a couple days only and then go to enjoy the beach

Switch out Philippines for Taiwan. Impossible to pick a bad city there. Just make sure you don’t stay in Taipei the whole time. I also love Tainan, Hualien, and Kaohsiung

        Also, June/July is hot & rainy season in Philippines, so I agree with skipping it.

First of all, all those countries for just 1 month will be a rush and you wouldn't see much. You'll just be wasting a lot of time travelling on planes/buses/ferries...

Unless you only want to visit cities (which to me aren't that interesting for more than 2-3 days) I feel you'll be missing too much. You'd be better off picking 1 or two of those. 

You can easily spend a month in all those countries (other than Singapore - 2-3 days max is enough).

I'd decide what you want to do most. Beaches, history, sight seeing, nightlife... And then decide on just a couple of those. Otherwise if you try to fit too much in you'll maybe only get to visit 1-2 places per country. 

Personally I'd choose Japan or the Philippines. Never been to Japan but want to go, an dive spent 2 months island hopping the Philippines. 

You can do a lot of stuff yourself. I terms of getting around 12go.asia is good for booking buses/trains/ferries... 

If you are after just day tours - Klook, Get Your Guide and Viator are good for finding and booking stuff. But there will alos be others locally that could be cheaper that aren't on those apps.

This is really ambitious for 4 weeks. For reference, I spent 6 weeks with the following itinerary:

Myanmar (Yangon, Bagan, Inle Lake- honestly NOT recommended b/c of ongoing genocide & general brutal suppression by military dictatorship)
Cambodia (Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat)
Malaysia (KL, Kinabatangan Borneo)
Vietnam (Hanoi, Halong Bay cruise, HCM)

We spent >1 week in Angkor & were just able to get through the major ruins plus a day trip hiking to a natural spring.

If you’re outdoorsy/adventurous, you could spend a decent amount of time in Borneo. Safari, mountaineering, diving, cave or jungle trekking…

Agree with folks here re:Philippines to skip Manila & choose a beach destination instead. We enjoyed Cebu & Bohol!

I’ve only travelled in the south east Asia side and honestly you don’t need to do more than 2 days in Singapore. I would look at Malaysia more, Kuala Lumpur, or one of the islands. It’s also cheaper than Singapore.

3 countries max.  You have to factor in down time, or wasting a whole day traveling.  Personally, I would do Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, or Vietnam.   Relax and enjoy your time.  If not, you're going to waste so much time getting from point A to B, and having to get to and check in and out of hotels all of the time.   I know it's tempting to try to do that much in a month, but trust me, it will go by fast.   Vietnam has been my new place, but I love Cambodia and Laos.   I spent a year in Thailand in the 80's, and it's just not the same anymore.

Sounds like an epic graduation celebration! To avoid burnout, I’d suggest sticking to 3-4 major stops. Start with Thailand (Bangkok and Phuket for the food and beaches), then head to Vietnam (maybe Hanoi for culture or Ho Chi Minh for energy). After that, visit your friend in Singapore, and if you’re up for it, stop in Taiwan (Taipei is super fun) before heading to Japan.

If you’re considering China, Hong Kong or Macau could be quick but fascinating stops. Check out this guide that helped me when I was traveling in China [https://gowithguide.com/China](https://gowithguide.com/China) Congrats on med school, and enjoy the adventure! 🎉

Fly to Krabi from Bangkok

Bus to Ko Lanta from the airport 

Stay at Khlong Nin Beach

This is a mature chill beautiful beach where middle age European families stay. 

Use Google maps to find a good hotel. 

I recommend the Emerald Beach snorkel tour, try to find a boat with less then 10-15 people on it.

    I second Krabi.

I took my son to Thailand when he was 10, but had the luxury of not having to plan the itinerary (my brother's wife is from Thailand, she has a lot of family there, we do a "road trip" type of vacation with them every time we go, in addition to some time just relaxing at their house, and I just have to show up and pay my share of whatever it all costs).  It's also going to depend a lot on what your kid likes in general.

We spent a few nights in floating cabins (there's a room with a bed, plus a porch, as an individual unit, and a bunch are lashed together around a cove in a lake, so you can swim right from your front porch.  And then there's also a floating restaurant, then the usual squatty-potty up on a hillside nearby.  There were boat tours you could take to see cool rock formations and wildlife, probably hiking on shore (it's a national park) though we didn't do that, and of course all the swimming you can stand.  The national park is Khao Sok, and I'm guessing there's more than one operator of cabins like that, but I'm not sure the exact one or place we went to, since other people made the arrangements.

My son also enjoyed markets and just walking around and seeing all the different food from usual, as well as the touristy stuff.  He bought a laser pointer that my brother (former airline pilot) said is probably illegal for a consumer to own in the US, and definitely to never point it at airplanes.  

We did go to a couple beaches, like in Hua Hin, very briefly in Phuket, and then in Singapore when we had a 23-hour layover there.  If your kid is into specific beach activities (snorkeling, kayaking, whatever), you might want to research the best places to be able to do those activities.

Temples are cool, as are ancient ruins--too many options to name specific ones, but you can google or ask for more specific recommendations.

Or if you end up going north instead of to beaches, Chiang Mai is cool, but the white temple in Chiang Rai (a little farther north) is really awesome, even for a teenager sick of looking at temples.  It's cool from every angle, but when you get inside the main building (it's one-way walking), turn around and look at the wall behind you.  The artwork on the walls includes lots of modern references, with the artist's opinion on how close they are to Buddhists' version of  "heaven" or "hell" indicated by how high or low they are on the wall.  

I forget where exactly in Thailand these are, but they were on our trip to the north, but there's a crack that opened up after an earthquake not all that long ago, and the people who own the land have created trails for you to explore it a bit, so that's kinda cool.  I seem to recall they had rolling "sleds" you could ride, too.  And there are various waterfalls you can swim in, hot springs you can cook an egg in, and we went to some canyon thing that was pretty cool, too.  If you want specifics, I can probably search my (and my sibs') Facebook posts for a little more info.

It wasn't on the trip with my kiddo, but we went to Pu Chi Fa in the far north, and there was frost on the ground one morning, which amazed all the tourists from around there, and we did a sunrise hike to the Laos border (picked up in a songthaew at like 4 a.m., driven to the trailhead, hiked in the dark becoming lighter, arrived at the summit before sunrise, and watched the sun come up over the forested hills of Laos.  

You can do an official border crossing into Laos and/or Myanmar near the Golden Triangle area, or there was one we walked across a bridge into a touristy market in Myanmar (but they keep your passports at the border control office so you can't just wander into the rest of the country at will).

There are elephant sanctuaries all around Thailand, but do your research on which ones actually benefit the elephants and put them first, not tourists.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head right now, but yeah, if you want specifics on any of the places I mentioned going to, I can try to find out more.

    thanks!  what month were you at Khao Sok?

        I don't remember specifically, but we've always gone in December-January, so around then.  Perfectly pleasantly warm, not as crazy hot as the other seasons.  (Coming off the rainy season though, so one trip we took it was still pretty humid and there was flooding still going down.)

Kanchanaburi is pretty nice and chill. Getting a bike and just driving to all the temples or going out and just getting lost. You'll find yourself in some scenic places. 

If you want beach but not party central, check out Koh Chang.

    My brother just took his family to Koh Chang on their most recent trip to Thailand, with my nephew who is 8, so they clearly agree that it's family-friendly.

If you're into "adventure, landscape, nature, thrill" then you can cut both Bangkok and Singapore down to a minimum or totally. Do a 5-day PADI dive course at Krabi. Personally I wouldn't bother with Singapore. There is none of those 4 things you want there IMO. Go visit the Golden Triangle or something in Thailand or do some treking.

    Phuket too. Have a look on Travelfish. There are a dozen islands (many accessible from Krabi) more fitting for what you’re after in Thailand.

You can easily visit Tiger Cave and the hot springs as a half-day trip from Krabi—there’s no need to spend the night there. I’d also suggest cutting down your time in Phuket unless partying is your priority; it’s a bit too touristy for my taste.

For accommodations in Krabi, consider Ao Nang or Noppharat Thara. Both are fantastic options and far better than staying in Krabi Town. From these spots, you can easily visit Railay and Tonsai Beach by canoe or a small boat. In general, Ao Nang makes an excellent base for exploring the nearby islands and attractions.

Stay directly in Koh Tao and Koh Phangan if possible to explore those islands. You can take ferries / jet boats but they have a vibe of their own, and it's nice to avoid the ferry day trip stuff. If you want dives, Koh Tao is some of the best. You could easily spend 3-4 days there alone just diving, relaxing, eating fish, etc. 

Phi Phi is great and I'd recommend it even if you can't find the best accomodations, but you may want to consider Railay or Ao Nang as alternatives.

I am just about to leave Thailand after 3.5 weeks here and I'd suggest you cut down on your destinations a lot.

Transiting between places took a lot longer than we had anticipated *every time* so we lost more time than expected transiting so would definitely change that were we to do the trip again. 

I'd suggest not staying anywhere for less than 3 nights, if not 4. We did mostly 3 night stops and a couple of 2s and the 2s felt pretty much pointless and the 3s felt rushed

Siem Reap. Angkor Wat is great, Bayon temple is great, Ta Prohm is amazing.

Krabi is great too, by the way. If you're not there to party, I'd go for Krabi and Phang Nga over Phuket. In Bangkok, see if you can find a reputable street food tour. So good.

Full disclosure: Chiang Mai was over 20 years ago so my memories are a bit foggy. Siem Reap five years ago or so, Krabi and Phang Nga 8 or 9 years ago. Haven't been to Phuket.

Siem Reap temple complex is almost like an outdoor museum, and the huge trees with roots in the temple complex add to the incredible atmosphere.  It’s a once in a lifetime experience without equal and we’ve seen quite a few wonders of the world.  In Chiang Mai there are things to see and do and it’s interesting enough but doesn’t come close to Siem Reap.  If I could only choose 1, it would be Siem Reap 1000 times over.  When we went, the guide wanted to meet us at 4:30 am at our hotel.  I said no way, I’m on vaca, what on earth for ? He said “to see the sun rise over Ankhor Watt”.  We compromised and met slightly later, it was still dark.  It was totally worth it !

Chiang Mai is nice. It has a sleepy, sorta hippie vibe that is completely different from Bangkok. But nothing compares to the temples near Siem Reap in Cambodia. If you go, hire a tuk tuk driver to take you around for two days and make sure to hit up smaller temples like Tha Prom, not just Angkor Wat.

Siem reap. Angkor is beyond stunning and indescribable. Also, the downtown of Siem reap has some really good food. 

At our hotel we were able to pay for a tour with a private tour guide, air conditioned car, and a packed lunch from the hotel and it was pretty cheap.

>Which would you suggest?

Siem Reap. While there try and see the Phare Circus, the skill shown by the performers is excellent and they tell a story at the same time... well worth the fee. I love Chiang Mai, the temples are cool, November is the perfect time of year but Angkor Wat is a better experience overall. I also agree with another commenter, go to the Killing Fields and S21 in Phnom Penh... it's eye opening.

Another vote for Siem Reap. Chiang Mai is fine, but Angkor is spectacular.

Went to Thailand just a year ago, with the same set of cities, id say you can book personal tours (just you and a driver for basically all morning) for really super cheap.

        Sabah is famous for its beach, nature and wildlife. Even if you only make Kota Kinabalu (capital city of Sabah) your base, pristine islands are just 30 mins boat ride away and mountain view destinations are just 2-3 hour car ride away. 

Malacca/Penang is more history and culture. Cameron Highlands while having beautiful scenery, does not beat the highland sceneries in Sabah in my opinion. I wouldn't skip Sabah if I were you.

Since you're prefer more on the nature side I'd skip Kuala Lumpur if I were you. Its just a typical metropolitan with some historical site. 

Also note that the only way to go from Kuala Lumpur to Sabah is by flight.

 Add more day in Sabah.



Beach: Semporna

Mountain and Hills: Kundasang

Rainforest: Lembah Danum (very remote and isolated eco-tourimt area but seems like many western people went here more than the local)

Have you visited Chiang Mai? It’s not a beach location, but it’s easy (and inexpensive) to reach by plane from other regions in Thailand and it has a lot to offer: elephants, amazing food (khao soi), and a sticky waterfall (Bua Thong). We took our children a few years ago when they were around the same age as your children and we had a great time.

    Yes I have a couple of times over the past 20 years! We hadn't planned for an inland trip this time, mainly wanted to focus on the sea, watersports, island boat trips etc! I'll keep it in mind though, it might be a cooler location too. Thanks 🙂

That's fine but I'd probably fly to Krabi and go straight to Koh Lanta, then stay in Krabi (Railay or Tonsai beach usually, or maybe Ao Nang if you prefer shopping over activities), then Phi Phi, then Phuket.

That's the direction the ferry usually takes. If you go out to Phi Phi and then back to Koh Lanta you're backtracking unnecessarily.

Koh Samui is not really an option, it's miles away on the other side of the coast.

Just do Bangkok and one of the islands in the south. It's pointless to see more than one in a single trip. All are fine options to relax for a week, and I can't image why you'd want to spend all that time traveling between them. 

Bangkok few days excitement and food, southern island for one week relaxation on the sea.

You're traveling during the high season for tourism in Thailand. Highly advise to book accommodation at least 2 weeks in advance.

It's highly unlikely many will read your post, especially in that format.

**Bottom line:** 7 countries in 97 days is of course totally doable. It's also great that you've done massive research and have so much planned. Many people come onto this forum and expect everyone to be their private Travel Agent. It's fabulous that you've put so much effort into your trip.

That said, a few thoughts...

Be ready to throw much of your itinerary in the trash for 3 main reasons:

**i.** You're going to love some places and want to stay longer.

**ii.** You're going to not like the vibe in some places and want to leave sooner.

**ii.** You're going to learn about places that you never heard of from locals and other travellers, and some of those places are going to sound fantastic and you'll want to check them out.

**Bottom, bottom line:** The HUGE advantage of a long 97 day trip is freedom. You are blessed with the flexibility to go with the flow and make the trip fantastic. You aren't nailed to a specific itinerary, you have the ability to adapt. *Be open to getting off the beaten path.*

At least please consider this approach.

Good luck with your research and happy travels. You're going to see some great stuff.

    Yeah, Reddit kind of killed my formatting. I'm definitely looking forward to the freedom to change my schedule at will. Typically I like to have my trips a bit over planned so that I can make educated changes on the fly once things come up. 

The biggest sticking points for this trip will be that I'll have to have my Vietnam cave tour scheduled significantly in advance, and I'll have a friend joining for a week in Cambodia. I'll still have a lot of flexibility, but some of my dates will be more set in stone

Comment:
i think it’s horrible to plan a 3 months trip that detailed. with that time on hand its way better to go with the flow and enjoy a few places longer. you might meet people along the journey and want to spend more time or travel somewhere with them. in SEA everything can be organized from one day to the other. no reason in planning everything out in detail before even starting the journey. And with that many places and your rush through the countries and its landmarks you will at some point burn out. its gets really tiring to move every few days to a new place. to literaly wake up every morning to do the next activity, etc…

-----------------------------
Comment:
If you're going to do Malaysia, go somewhere more interesting than KL - Penang, for example. Much more to do and see there in three days and easily flyable from Singapore with Air Asia. Otherwise, I'd just skip it altogether and have another day in SG and a couple more in Lombok.

You have 3 months... Just go with the flow lol

Comment:
The schedule is kind of hard to follow for me but I do see a few things I could input here:

for hiking / trekking in Indonesia, maybe look into Java. There are many lesser visited peaks that could be perfect to help you get ready for Nepal. There are also some other peaks nearby to Rinjani like Pergasingan Hill. Shorter but good ones to get into hiking straight up. 

In Bali, Batur was quite easy, I believe there are two routes, one harder one so maybe look into that if you plan to climb it. 

Vientiane - you really only need 1 day here, there is not too much to do. This could be another day allocated to Indonesia! (https://www.girlgonecoconuts.com/asia-travel/one-day-in-vientiane)

Singapore - have you been? It is quite expensive, and you might find 4 days is too much. Ive actually been here a couple of time for visa runs and every time I go I question why I went. Again, could be more days elsewhere if you end up agreeing. 

I do believe this is all entirely doable but as the person below me said, keep this itinerary but be ready to go with the flow. Some places will really surprise you (vang vieng i.e. for me and Ninh Binh Vietnam), others you will wonder "why am I here" (i.e. Singapore for me). SO my point? Keep the itinerary as a loose idea of the direction you are going but dont book too far ahead so you can gauge how youre feeling PLUS you'll need some downtime to rest and recover from always being on the go! 

I hope this helps :)

I’d recommend giving yourself rest days travelling to a new location every 3-4 days is a more draining than you’d realise, especially with the stress of travelling in unfamiliar countries.

Give yourself at least 1-2 days to do nothing, take stock, do laundry every 2 weeks or so. I’d do that in lower COL places to save money too

Comment:
I've been to Vietnam for 3 weeks, Philippines for 3 weeks and Cambodia for 3 days. 



My 2 cents. 4 nights in hoi an is way too much. There isn't really anything to do there as far as I'm aware. We walked around all day and saw the lanterns/boats when it got dark. Even a full day felt like too much time there.  



Vietnam in general I wasn't a super big fan of. But that may be a personal thing. Very crowded in Hanoi, and again, not much to do and we didn't enjoy the food much. I liked da nang a lot better. The caves and bana hills were pretty cool



In the Philippines I went to manila, Cebu, boracay and Coron.  Coron has some super cool scenery and tours we went on. Cebu has some cool tours, we swam with whale sharks and saw a bear church.  but you have to travel a long way to get to them. Borocay is an amazing beach with some expensive water sport activities. And they have a bit more western type of food there from my experience. Philippines is great for ocean/beach/nature experiences. 




Cambodia was super cool for the little time I was there. People were super super friendly and Angkor wat/ the surrounding temples were crazy cool.  




Maybe not helpful. Just my experience in SE Asia. Your schedule sounds very very busy and tiring.

-----------------------------
Comment:
For me that’s too much traveling yeah. I’d cut out the Khao Sok, Ao Nang part and then it becomes much more reasonable. I prefer 3 nights in any given place. 2 at a minimum.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Yeah, this seems way too packed. You're overdoing it.

I haven't done Cambodia yet, but I'm told you can spend many days at Angkor Wat. Two nights does seem very crowded, especially in-and-out of the whole country that fast. On that point alone your itinerary is immediately too crowded.

Three nights in Phuket with a day trip to Koh Phi Phi is going to be super frustrating, you barely have any time to soak any of it in. The south should be a time to relax. You've done the same thing on the gulf side, a "day trip to Koh Phangan" from Koh Samui is insanity, you won't get any of the night life or time to enjoy the island.

**As a general rule, don't stay a just single night in a place you actually want to visit. You won't have enough time to actually experience it, and will be too focused on checking in and checking out to enjoy yourself.**

Personally speaking, I'd:

* Take just a little more time in Bangkok. It's a cool city. Lots to see.
* Nix Cambodia entirely. Sorry. Thailand is a big country, doing a two-day fly-in-fly-out sideshow to Cambodia is lunacy to me. (If you must do Cambodia, think hard about significantly reshaping your Thailand part of the trip.)
* Spend more time in Chiang Mai. Give yourself breathing room. There's a lot to see there, great food, awesome culture. Don't rush it. I'd have gone to Pai, but you have a packed itinerary already.
* Dump Koh Samui, just stay on the Andaman (Phuket) side, where it seems you have more interest. Consider an overnight on Koh Phi Phi rather than doing a day trip. Take more time in Ao Nang. Fly back from Krabi, rather than Koh Samui.

That should give you a little more breathing room.

Sample itinerary, based on what you already have — looks like 17 nights, I'd do something more like:

1. Bangkok (fly in, relax, sleep)
2. Chiang Mai (travel day, arrival)
3. Chiang Mai
4. Chiang Mai
5. Chai Lai (travel day, arrival)
6. Chai Lai
7. Phuket (travel day, arrival)
8. Phuket
9. Khao Sok (travel day, arrival)
10. Khao Sok
11. Ao Nang (travel day, arrival)
12. Ao Nang
13. Ao Nang — Koh Phi Phi
14. Ao Nang — Railay
15. Bangkok (travel day, arrival)
16. Bangkok
17. Bangkok

Adjust above as needed / based on your own vibes. You can see: 

* Cambodia is gone.
* I've pushed out Khao Sok and Chai Lai to two nights each. 
* Koh Phi Phi is now an optional trip from Ao Nang. It's closer, and you can choose to stay in Ao Nang instead or do Railay based on vibes. 
* Bangkok is moved to the end of the trip — you don't want to miss your flight back to Toronto, so if anything goes wrong while you're island hopping, you'll be glad you have the buffer room.

    First off thanks for the time you put into this response, appreciate your advice.

I agree and I'm going to drop Cambodia, but Khao Sok and Chai Lai I will keep as one night I think it's enough for those small excursions.  I may take the extra 2 nights from Cambodia and use them forr Pai.  I also want to keep Samui as I've heard great things online and from friends, and we have a nice resort "Vana Belle" picked out to finish the trip at a luxury resort.  Not sure if I'll be able to fit in Phangan or Koh Tao if you're saying a day trip is not worth it.  A friend of mine said bottle beach viewpoint was a highlight.

Do you recommend I drop Phuket completely and just Fly from Chiang Mai into Krabi?  And use Ao Nang as a base for a couple daytrips to Railay, and Koh Phi Phi, or maybe James Bond island?

For culture and nightlife, I prefer Koh Tao and Koh Phangan to Koh Samui, for what's it's worth. But if you're just staying at a luxury resort, then Koh Samui is fine. They're very similar islands. You can do Koh Phangan or Koh Tao within a day by speedboat,  just factor in that you're spending a about hour on boat/pier each way. 

>Do you recommend I drop Phuket completely and just Fly from Chiang Mai into Krabi? 

Personally, I like the spectacle that is Phuket, especially Bangla Road. It's something a little different, just a total change of pace. But it's not for everyone, and going straight to Krabi makes some sense if you want to keep things chill. 

>And use Ao Nang as a base for a couple daytrips to Railay, and Koh Phi Phi, or maybe James Bond island?

Yeah this seems reasonable. A lot of people around Ao Nang and Railay are just taking longtail boats to different beaches and doing island hopping during the day, there are a tonne of choices.

        I'm sad you're going to drop Siem Reap/Cambodia.  Angkor Wat and the other buildings in the park are amazing and better to see it sooner than later.  I spent 5 days twice in the park and surrounds and still didn't see all of it but 3 days would be a great use of your time.   You would also experience another country besides Thailand.

            Reply:3
            I really want to see it, but am wary of too much travel days.  If I did something similar to below I could fit it in as I originally intended while reducing the amount of flights for some ferries instead.

But so many people are saying it’s crazy to travel to siem reap just for 2 nights, and I would have to take a connecting flight through Bangkok to chisng mai on the way back.

                Well Siem Reap airport is very close to the Angkor Wat park and it's very well organized.  3 nights is fine.   But then for me  I am not that crazy about beaches as I only snorkel don't really swim.   Or here is a possibility, if you rreally are not going to do Angkor Wat, you can go to Ayuthaya on a 1 night or day trip from Bangkok.  Nowhere near as good as Angkor Wats fantastic temples but will give you a small glimpse of ancient majesty.

I'd delete Khao Sok and add a day to Bangkok which is endlessly fascinating. I'd also encourage you to take a ferry from phuket to krabi and a bus from krabi to surat thani to get the ferry to koh samui. I haven't been to koh phangan but I thought Koh Tao was great. I usually discourage people from renting cars in SEA - on the off-chance something goes wrong you get more trouble than it's worth. Take the bus.

Hi there! I travelled Thailand twice, once in a rush and once chill.

If you are alone you will be good with:

- Add an extra night in BKK after landing, there's a lot to do and you have to recover from jet lag  
- Do not miss Angkor Wat, I did in an out of cambodja with 2 nights, if you are not a freak you will have plenty with one day 5am to 1pm with a tuktuk driver in Angkor Wat, its spectacular  
- Drop Phuket, the rest of your itinerary is much more worth it  
- I'd drop Khao Sok because of the rental car hassle. To me Krabi was nicer than Phuket and you can do Phi Phi from there as well.

Rest is fine.

    Reply:1
    How bad was the in-out of cambodia, were you coming from Thailand?  Was the airport/customs a hassle?  Is 2 nights enough or should I try to do 3 and remove Phuket which makes it less travel later in the trip and gives me plenty of rest time.  

Also debating if I should stay a night in Phi Phi or just do the day trip tour.

        Reply:2
        100% remove phuket, the airport is far and the old town and patong are not worth it. Whats good is to get lost in its beaches but the island is massive so it takes too much time compared to exploring koh samui, koh tao etc. or even Krabi.

I entered cambodja from vietnam by plane and got off by van to bangkok. Siem reap you can see the day or afternoon you arrive and the afternoon after Angkor, and that will be plenty if you are a fast travel which it is by the soubd of yoour original itinerary. Just dont miss Angkor since its the best landmark in all SE Asia, its so different from anything else.

I think I am going with this as my final itinerary, done my research and many people have gone in-out of Siem Reap in 2 nights and say it was worth seeing.  Very busy at the start of the trip but I have a couple easy days mixed in, and then a full week of island relaxation to finish.  Staying minimum 2 nights a stop except for Khao Sok.

I also cut Phuket completely based on 90% of people saying to skip it (hoping I don't regret it), and will spend the extra $ to taxi to Khao Sok and to the ferry pier rather then rent a car.

Koh Phi Phi was a super party island when I went there, you probably aren't going to feel the vibes (although it is super pretty). For hostels, I suggest getting to seek out the more chill hostels rather than party hostels. Unless you're a party animal, I always found it far easier to meet people there. 

Day tours are another good way to meet people.

But in general, the north is more relaxed and might be what you need if you're feeling a bit down at the moment with your socialising. 

Honestly, you don't need to try and visit every island, you've seen a couple, you're good to continue to something else, you're not missing out too much.

It’s been a reeeeaaallly long time since I went to Thailand but we had a pretty chilled time down at Railay Beach. Was definitely less party party party. Koh Lanta and Phi Phi were ok then, but probably much busier now, although less busy than Phuket. I think places that require just that little bit more effort to get to might be quieter - although then you run the risk of just being couples. Railay has good rock climbing so does attract people for that.

I’m not super familiar with Thailand, but where I’m at hostels often have organized group excursions. Or you could do like Viator or trip advisor group tours. I think it’d be easier to meet people and strike up conversations while doing something active rather than sitting at a bar.

Phi Phi is great! I don’t think Phuket  on a budget would be that great, and Krabi… just no. We met some great people on Samui though! Tao is mostly for divers. Give northern Thailand a shot. You might meet some fun people in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai.

A work buddy of mine just came back from Phuket and said he’ll never go back.  He’s been going to Thailand every year for the last 10-15 years.

Apparently it’s now overrun with Russians to the point where they oftentimes outnumber the locals.

There is also a lot new “communities” being built specifically for Russian migrants.

Apparently the only safe way to get cash is to get it at your hotel because if you take money out at an ATM you’re likely followed by Russians looking for a chance to rob you.

One of the other tourists at my buddy’s hotel went to a local tailor and when they walked into the store there was a Russian guy beating up the store owner.

The local police seem powerless to deal with the poor behaviour and outright crime.

It’s apparently pretty crazy in Phuket right now.

My general critique, or better, question is, do you want to be on the move so much for five months? I get that you want to see it all and experience it all, but I would be concerned about being exhausted by the end of month two or three, simply from all the resettling. 

Is there any place you might consider prioritizing over somewhere else that could be dropped (or put in an "if there's time" / "if other travelers say we can't miss it" category)?

    Reply:1
    It's definitely something something we've thought about and I guess the conclusion we've come to is if we do start to get burnt out from all the moving around we'll just have to slow down and as you suggested, miss some places completely. Generally we actually enjoy moving around to different places and hotels/areas and have had some busy holidays in the past, but they were less than a month. So we could definitely have to re-evaluate after the first two or three months

You definitely don’t need to move around that much for Bali. You can do a lot by staying at one place and using your driver to visit places rather than staying there which I would highly recommend.

    Reply:1
    Yep that makes sense. Are you referring mainly to the Munduk - Lovina - Kintamani part of the Bali trip? Where would you suggest staying as a base? Would you then find a driver in that area and stick with them or just use grab or gojek to get around?

        Reply:2
        I live in Bali and with your itinerary I would skip Lovina, one of the worst beaches in Bali. From Ubud east day trips to Munduk, Bedugul, Batur/Kintamani. App based drivers don't make sense for multi point trips, better to use local drivers, easy to meet and hire on the spot.

            Reply:3
            Okay that’s great, Lovina was the only stop we were unsure about so that makes things easier. Is there anything else or anywhere else you’d recommend us to visit while we’re there?

                Well this wd add more days but if you do want to see north Bali go to Pemuteran and cross over to Java and hike Ijen. Indonesia has sooo much to see and do you could easily do a month and just scratch the surface of a few islands and never even get to Borneo, Sumatra, Flores, Sulawesi etc

                    Reply:5
                    That's fine. We are still undecided on how to spend the last couple of weeks so we could look into extending our visa to give us an extra week or two in Indonesia. I'm going to look into the places you've mentioned now. Much appreciated, thank you!

        Reply:2
        Find a driver - you could try using Klook otherwise Bali Bogans (Aussie Based is a good start to find a driver). 

I have only stayed in Canggu/Seminyak (5 times).  Canggu traffic is rough. It sounds like Ubud might be the go for you but I’d check if they’re close to the other parts you want to travel! 

Also definitely don’t think you need to spend longer than 3 days in Phuket for Thailand - the islands are where it’s at!

Comment:
It seems like you are somewhat randomly picking locations and assigning them stay nights. Some places can be a day trip on the way to somewhere else and some places might be interesting enough to stay longer. Try giving yourself enough flexibility to change the routes if somewhere is not as interesting as you might have thought.

    Reply:1
    Or break your post up into countries to make it easier to respond. Example why KL twice for 2 and 3 nights, or Gili Air and T separately.. Just combine them together.

        Reply:2
        Good point about KL. The initial idea was to keep it a bit cheaper by getting a train from KL to Penang so rather than spending the whole day traveling we'd break it into smaller chunks and fly to KL enjoy it for a few days then have another couple hours of travel to George Town. Then when we finish in Langkawi Spend the the day traveling back to KL and have another day or two before heading to Bali.  Thinking about it now the better option would be to just fly from Phnom to George Town, and have 4 nights in KL and go to Bali a day earlier. Thanks for pointing that out. 

The reason we have split up Gili Air and T is to be able to chill out in Air and enjoy the beach. Then head to Gili T to enjoy the nightlife which will be easier if we're staying on the island itself I think

    Thanks for the comment this is super helpful!

  
We've definitely seen plenty of comments about skipping Phuket. We might cut out Phuket old town altogether and spend the extra 3 nights in Railay instead. We've heard nothing but good things about Railay.

  
Great to know that about Hoi An. We'll never say no to an extra night at a beach! We looked into Ha Long and it really seems to split opinions. In the end it came down to Ha Long or the Ha Giang Loop. My friend has lived in Vietnam 3 years and he done a 4 night trip around the loop about two weeks ago. He said it's the best thing he's done since arriving there so that swung us towards Ha Gang. I'll definitely look into Lan Ha though!

We could take or leave Vientiane. We're mainly just using it to break up the travel from Vang Vieng to Pakse. If you could have spent an extra day or two somewhere when you were in Laos where would it have been? Thanks for the tip about the trains!

Absolutely, we'll be more than happy to miss an excursion and just wonder around close to the hotel if the we get tired of all the moving. One day to recharge and just chill out in the room will be plenty if we need it.

        Reply:2
        The only places I wish I had more time were Siem Reap and Luang Prabang. Both are lovely cities with great vibes. There is loads to do in Siem Reap that I missed out on because we had 4 days and spent 3 at Angkor Watt (visiting the rats for example). I think I would have loved an extra night at Luang Prabang eating in the nightmarket and wandering around the town. 

I would also suggest (depending on your route and if you have time) the slow boat from Luang Prabang to Thailand (near Chaing Rai). It takes 2 days but the scenery is lovely.

Damn planning out every night on a 6 month trip is frigging exhausting. Definitely no need to stick to anything so rigid. First thing that jumped out at me was 5 nights in Phnom Penh, but only 3 in Bangkok? That’s backwards. And unless you just want to relax and do nothing, 7 nights in Ubud and 5 in Langkawi are both too long imo. Maybe I missed something but I thought Langkawi was lame as hell, one of the few destinations in SEA I’d be fine recommending to skip completely. 

For a next destination, if you like fantastic beaches, great scuba/snorkeling, waterfalls, scooters, super friendly people and 80’s rock ballads, i highly recommend the Philippines

    Reply:1
    Tell me about it! We mainly done it to figure out how much we're going to be paying for accommodation in each place before we go to make it easier to stick to a budget in each country.

So with Phnom Penh the first day will be a bit of a write off after spending most of the day traveling from Battambang. We're looking at it as being 3 full days, we love the hotel we found there. The extra night after Koh Rong is just to give us more flexibility with flights as getting from Koh Kong to Phnom Penh will take between 7 and 9 hours.

I would like to spend more time in Bangkok but I'm meeting my friend in Ho Chi Minh on the 10th so slightly limited there.

  
We love the look of Ubud so happy to relax there and spend some extra time wandering around. There are some great day trips from Langkawi so that'll use up 2 of those days most likely. The other days will just be chilling and recharging.

Yep the Philippines look amazing, it's most likely where we'll spend the rest of our time but it's definitely a lot more expensive than the other countries we're visiting when it comes to accommodation. The transport to get around some of the islands will also add up quickly I imagine but we might be able to make it work!

        Reply:2
        Gotcha, and I get that you need to throw in rest days somewhere, the problem is you often don’t know when you need them until your body tells you that you need them! And you can find out for yourself about Langkawi, I’d just say don’t book all 5 nights straight away :)

            Reply:3
            Oh yeah definitely, we have everything booked with free cancellation bar 2 or 3 hotels to keep things as flexible as possible while still roughly knowing what everything will cost! Good idea, we’ll book 3 and can extend or head back to George Town

That's waaaaay too much planning. So let's start with Phuket. No point staying near the airport then moving to the old town. Just pick a nice place to stay somewhere for three or four days and go there.

Next up - Ko Yao islands. Six nights for both is too much. There's not much there, and you can get from one to the other by chucking your scooter on a little ferry for an afternoon of exploring. Neither of them are very good for swimming because they are in the bay, and consequently quite muddy, with sea urchins, crabs and lots of rocks to boot. Good sunsets though.

Three nights on Ko Yao Yai would be enough, and add another night each to Phi Phi and Lanta.

Also, if you're going to Langkawi in Malaysia, why not just head south via Ko Lipe in southern Thailand? Flying north to Vietnam etc seems to be a lot of backtracking to end up back in the same place.

Comment:
If I were you I’d combine the el nido and Coron portions into El Nido -> Coron via the 3 day expedition. That’s by far the best thing to do in the phillipines and will be more productive than a bunch of island hoping tours (which get very tedious). Also, unless you dive, Coron is extremely boring, so you wouldn’t miss much by just going in the boat expedition then flying out after.

    Reply:1
    If they were a diver then Malapascua would be a must. That’s pretty out of the way with their current schedule though.

No, not at all.

Go where you want to go.Everyone likes different things and has different priorities, and time is limited.

Of course it's not mandatory to visit the Thai islands, but it is a distinct thing that people do. At the end of the day, assuming you have a limited schedule, adding something means removing something else right? Your characterisations of the Thai islands isn't wrong. During the day you might go on a boat trip where you can see some pretty things and do some snorkeling (I don't dive either), you can eat at a touristy cafe and sit on the beach. At night there are bars etc. You're right that it is touristy but it is a part of the backpackers circuit which you may or may not find appealing. 

If you want to experience some islandyness, Cambodia and Vietnam have their own scenes too you could look into, which you may find quicker to get to compared to travelling from Bangkok to somewhere like Koh Tao

    Reply:1
    Why not dive? The diving outfits in these places are heavily geared towards handling first time divers for obvious reasons, there really are few better places to try it as a one off thing.

        Reply:2
        No particular reason, it's just not something I've felt a need to try. Snorkeling has been enough for me. 

I'm also not a strong swimmer so floating on top with a life jacket on I've always enjoyed.

I did about two months in Vietnam and Thailand, south to north in Vietnam and then north to south in Thailand. I didn't make it down to the islands. They'll be there, I'll probably go again.

If you can make it to Sukhothai Historical Park, I really recommend it. It's more impressive and yet less busy than Ayutthaya.

Comment:
I haven't been there in a while so I can't tell which specific island it is in 2024. But there is probably an island in this set

> there are other less popular islands like Koh Lanta, Koh Lipe, Koh Chang etc. They look far too quiet for my liking

That is being overrun by the backpacker crowd as the place "the tourists haven't ruined yet" by which they mean they are currently ruining it but development hasn't caught up with demand so the lodging is still cheap instead of a bunch of modern hotels. 

Koh Tao had this situation when I visited a long time ago and it was a fun time worth spending a couple days on.

That's 36 days, which is 5 weeks and a day, not 6 weeks. Anyway. Are you open to alter the destinations, or just the time spent in each one? 2 days for Singapore is fine, but I'm not sure how tired you will be arriving. 2.5 for Penang would be too much for me, but others tend to spend more time there. 2.5 days for Bangkok might be a bit tight. 3 for Chiang Mai is fine. What are you planning in South Korea? You gave no details. The other places I haven't been to.

        Koh Samui is skippable, it caters to more high end resort crowds so if you don’t feel you need that I wouldn’t go.

Koh Tao is the scuba island, and if you only go for two days you’ll regret not having enough time to do a scuba course and really see why people go to the island. Also it will be a pretty rough itinerary for you to get back from Koh Tao.

If I were you I’d pick a side. Either gulf of Thailand (Koh Tao, Phanang, Samui) or the Andamin Sea (Phuket, Phi Phi, Krabi) and just stick with that.

            Reply:3
            Okay thanks a lot. Now I think about it more the main reason to head to koh samui was the waterfalls I heard about there but it’s not enough of a reason - I will take out samui & koh Tao

This seems real busy. Flying from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, are you sure you'll be able to do the elephant sancuatary in the same day? I did that a couple years ago, and while I don't know all the options, seem to remember it was a couple hours outside the city and most traveled in the morning

-----------------------------
Comment:
I haven’t been to Indonesia but I can comment on the Thailand part.

I doubt you can go to an elephant sanctuary in the evening. Usually those are all day or at least half day tours that leave in the morning. They are far from the city and you generally can’t just walk up and go in.

Take the night train to Chiang Mai instead of flying.

If I were you I’d cut the beach parts of Thailand and spend more time in the cities. You’ve gots lots of time in Indonesia to go to beaches and I feel like you’re way too pressed in Thailand.

-----------------------------
Comment:
That's a lot to do in not much time. I'd honestly cut out half. Bali doesn't look big on the map, but it's a big island that takes time to get around. I'd suggest choosing Thailand or Indonesia. Personally Indonesia is one of my favourite countries and Thailand the opposite. A few days in Labuan Bajo (near Komodo Island) is really nice. Java Island is tons of fun too and cheap, but travel distance can be a problem with limited time. I did 3 weeks in Indonesia and felt it was barely enough, but there's so much I missed.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Skip Chiang Mai. There's so much more you could do in Bangkok.  You are basically flying up (and eating the travel time each direction) to visit Temples, which Bangkok has. 

There are no KBV-DPS flights, so that travel day completely eaten by a transfer or two.

South Korean tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in Vietnam by a pretty big margin, so you'll probably end up meeting a lot of your compatriots there.

Tbh based on your criteria Indonesia/bali would be an option. You don’t have to stay in the tourist heavy areas though, like Canggu or Seminyak, there’s remote places around the island, also plenty of other smaller islands around that you can just jump on a boat and go check out. Some of the beaches are honestly some of the most beautiful places I’ve ever witnessed. It’s super easy to make friends with travelers, expats, and locals in Bali and its surrounding islands. I also enjoyed Bali itself I surfed every single day, ate super healthy, and met a ton of interesting people from all over the place with tons of unique stories. 

Vietnam would be my second choice after Indonesia.

Come to Malaysia, most Malaysian speak very fluent English. (And its common for middle class family to speak english) They are very friendly and would be happy to help you out if you need any help.

If you’re into food, Malaysian is heaven for food lovers. The food is so diverse and you get to eat indian, chinese and malay cuisine. 

Why Malaysia >>>>> other Southeast Asian countries?

1. It’s safe. 4th safest country in asia
2. No natural disasters 
3. Has good highway connectivity and infrastructure 
4. No language barrier (Mandarin and English are widely spoken)
5. Has beaches
6. Not too many tourists (compared to Thailand)
7. Local would love to be friends with you (especially foreigners)
8. Its cheap. Kuala Lumpur is cheaper than Bangkok, Singapore, Phnom Penh etc…

    Which places to visit in Malaysia

        Reply:2
        If you are visiting for the first time, Kuala Lumpur can be your starting point, then go on a 4 hour road trip to Georgetown,Penang. Make sure you pay a visit to Ipoh along the way.

If you want to go to place that not many people have been to.. try Brunei. It's a small country . To some people it may considered a boring place but the people are friendly and most speak good English.

Vietnam is awesome but you need to be willing to move. Chang Mai is great but you stayed for a month? There’s loads of great places in Northern Thailand. Move with a group you like and that can easily be 2/3 weeks with the same people and you see more of the country. 

The other option is work in a hostel, you’ll still have lots of people coming and going but some of the other hostel workers maybe a bit more long term if they love a place.

You can take the direct flight from ICN to VTE and explore Laos using the train. Check out Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang. You just need to find the right hostels were backpackers stay for longer.

Vietnam is incredible, but I’m not sure how easy it would be to hang out with locals there. They were friendly but always seemed so busy and not especially chatty. Philippines would be my vote, so many people were up for a chat or hanging out, and pretty much everyone spoke English

I think Indonesia is comparable to Thailand and better food than the Philippines. Every island has a different culture and there are so many things to do, historical sites, nature reserves, hiking, volcanos, pristine beaches, diving, surfing etc. 

I used to have Thailand as my number 1 with Vietnam second, but we’ve been exploring Indonesia the last few years and I can’t get enough of it lol

    I live in Thailand, but Indonesia is amazing. I found that the people especially are incredibly friendly. If not for the religious aspect I would consider living there.

        Reply:2
        The people are SO friendly. And regarding the religious aspect, there are several Christian majority provinces and of course Bali is majority Hindu. 

I do find Indonesia, like Malaysia, to be follow a much gentler form of Islam, than say the ME. Very similar to southern Thailand. i.e, not imposing strict laws on foreigners.

    Reply:1
    Indonesia is so extremely different. The sole fact they’re a (very religious) Muslim country, which is fine but they’re sooo different from Thailand lol. Maybe the nature is similar because of the climate, but other than that not sure what you’re refering to.

        Reply:2
        I actually don’t find Indonesian to be in your face religious like the UAE or Saudi for example. When travelling to those places, I need to be very aware of how I act, what I wear etc.

And as I said in my above comment, there are several provinces in Indonesia that aren’t Muslim majority at all. You’ll see more churches than mosques.

The OP mentioned activities and food. Going by that, I definitely think Indonesia is comparable and in some ways even exceeds Thailand.

                But southern Thailand is majority Muslim, as are some of the islands around Phuket. Regarding Malaysia some states are a lot more strict with Islamic law than others, but I’ve never felt uncomfortable being a Western tourist. 

In Indonesia if you go East from Lombok, you’ll barely see anyone wearing even a hijab. 

I definitely know what you mean about the different “feel” in Thailand due to it being majority Buddhist, but again, the OP wasn’t asking those questions. 

I grew up in the region and think Indonesia is underrated with the majority of travellers focusing on Bali and Lombok to a smaller extent. 

But there are literally thousands of islands to explore and except for call to prayer and halal food, I don’t feel religion imposed on me.

                    Yeah true but I don’t think many people go that far south. But you are right. 
Our experiences can definitely be different yeah. I do like Indonesia and I wish I felt a bit more comfortable there to travel around there. I definitely did feel safe and the people are very friendly but I just felt like I stuck out a lot lol.

                        Reply:6
                        Bali is a Hindu island, which would explain the difference compared to say Lombok, which is known as the island of a thousand mosques.

I've never felt safer really than going around Malaysia, because the people are so friendly and inquisitive as to why foreigners go there it is quite sweet really and some of the mosques in Kuala Lumpur are architecturally amazing.

                                People downvote when you may have a legit simple opinion. My uncomfortable experience was Cambodia. The cities are awful for a solo male traveller who doesn't want to be followed for sex or money or beer. I love all of SEA apart from that place, although I can highly recommend S21 and Angkor Wat to anyone.

    Vietnam is my favourite country in the world, so I would always pick Vietnam over Philippines in this scenario. The scenery in the north of Vietnam around Sapa/Ha Giang are sights I've never seen matched before or since and is a good time to go before it becomes even more overly commercialised.

Plus food is better in Vietnam, not just on taste - but also never got the shits in a month in Vietnam, was shitting out a lung within 4 days of the Phillies (altho taho is king!)

Is Thailand the best? Maybe, but that doesnt mean other countries there arent also amazing!

I've been to Thailand and the Philippines, but not Vietnam. Love Thailand (same route as you). Here's what I can say about the Philippines...if you love the beach and activities centered around the water, it's the most beautiful place I've been to. Coming from the US, I've had people ask me "should I go to XYZ place? the beaches look beautiful." Most of the time I say the Carribean or Bahamas has some of the nicest beaches in the world if thats what you're looking for...but after going to the Philippines, I was blown away.

The islands, water, beaches...stunning.

The Philippines has beautiful beaches! I went to Boracay, but heard Palawan is also amazing!

Depends what you like to do. Philippines for beaches/nature but Vietnam for food, cultural things. I live in Thailand but enjoy all of SEA. 

I’d really consider Indonesia though, especially if you like dramatic landscapes like volcanos, waterfalls. Indonesia is crazy diverse and has some of the most epic nature in the world. The people are also really kind and the food is decent (better than PH but not as good as Thailand or Vietnam IMO).

-----------------------------
Comment:
Might consider Malaysia or Vietnam, as they can be reached via trains from Thailand! And a train journey in Southeast Asia is a really interesting experience (slow ofc, but providing you with good opportunity to immersively experience the local culture and charm)

I (35M, Dutch) haven't been to Thailand, but I did visit Vietnam for a month a Philippines for a total of 5 months, spread out over several trips and years with my Filipino fiancée. Some highlights I can mention below.

Vietnam is a country that wants to develop. The infrastructure is there, the people are eagerly learning English, they are used to foreigners/backpackers (wrt to power distance and upping the price) and it has a (recent) history with a lot to offer.
Philippines is pretty much stagnant. Nobody really knows or wants to invest in improving the country as a whole to make it easier, nice, and more to do for a visit. Corruption and inefficiency in every (political) layer makes all development grind to a standstill.

>because of the food and range of activities available. 
If activities is your thing; go for Vietnam. Museums, sights and nature to see, history, motorbike tours, ...
Philippines has mostly water based activities (island tours, boat tours, snorkeling, diving, fish feeding, whale shark watching, etc). 

>I was thinking of my next trip being either Thai + Viet or Thai + Philippines.

Travel wise; Thailand and Vietnam are almost land connected, and Vietnam is pretty much 1 country. It's a country with trains, planes, and plenty of (private) bus/van connections available. To me, it felt like almost everybody knows a person to bring you from a to b, even overnight if needed. In other words; travel is easy, accessible and it gets done.
Philippines on the other hand; it's ~7000 island, mostly connected thru ferries (slow roll on, roll off one), or planes. Most of the tourist area are far apart (palawan, cebu region, siargao, manila/luzon,..) and always require a plane, taxi, tricycle combo to get to the next place. Transport over water is weather sensitive and a typhon sensitive country. Loading and unloading of a ferry can take ages (load capacity reached, overstacked, tetris puzzle getting cargo off,..). Even going to next island easily takes a day, and is a huge energy drainer in my experience. And I'm saying that even with a Filipino on my side doing all the works.

    Reply:1
    Those 5 hour vans from Puerta Princesa to El Nido are the least enjoyable journeys you can have, besides maybe a boat from Bali to Lombok followed by the taxi to the south of the island. 

Stick 14 people in a van made for 8, then if you're unlucky to be at the back row and be tall, you have everyone's luggage on your head for the duration. 

Wouldn't want to do that again.

I've been visiting Thailand for the last 12 years and it is amazing but it's definitely not stand-alone. I loved Vietnam, culture, food, activities and in a lot of areas, not so jaded by tourism but my favourite was sri lanka, mixture or rural and tourism, such kind people, being invited to eat with family and a few visits to the same restaurant and bar and you're treated like a local. Very very cultural but still a stone throw from pool bar resorts, ziplines, windsurfing, elephant hotels.. definitely worth a look 👌

    So why not just go to less popular areas if you don’t want touristy? As someone who has traveled all over the country to random places with my Thai wife, I can tell you most of Thailand is still surprised to see foreigners. The problem is everyone goes to the same 20 places they saw online.

Every country has it's own culture, landscapes and scenery, activities for tourists etc.  It really depends on what you are interested in.   I don't care about beaches but do love museums and ancient history, and every country has that for me (except Phils but it's top of many lists of people who like beaches)

Make your trip Vietnam+Philippines! Go to Vietnam for the food. For the Philippines, food is great also but avoid Manila (or just pass through) and go straight to the beaches!

How about Thai + Cambodia. I love Cambodia but didn't see nearly enough of it. The food is very similar to Thai but somehow better. You can travel by train between the two countries and Vietnam is an easy add-on.

I highly recommend Cambodia if you are interested in SE Asia. The food is not as good as in Thailand but the people, the amazing temples and overall vibe of the place is wonderful. Ive been twice and would happily go again. I know you asked about other countries so really just mentioning this as another place to look in to.

    Reply:1
    Ironically, it's the one I wouldn't recommend personally as I didn't have a good time. I found Angkor Wat amazing and the S21/Killing Fields to be very interesting, but I didn't find the locals friendly at all. Left for Vietnam pretty quickly.

That being said, I did only visit the main two cities, and I could be tempted to go again to smaller places to see the scenery, but not for a long time.

        Reply:2
        It may well be different now as I was there more than 10 years ago and the place has exploded with tourists. One person’s must see is often another’s never again! I had a terrible time in Morocco for example and find it difficult to understand why people rate it in their top 5 places to travel. 😊

            Reply:3
            Ironically went to both last year. Enjoyed Marrakech a lot 😂

The scams and being shown argan oil every 30 seconds can be annoying, but the food, busy streets and scenery of the atlas mountains were amazing. 

My big issue with Cambodia was the aggressiveness of the tuk tuk drivers trying to offer me sex. I don't mind being stopped but to be actively followed really made me feel uncomfortable. Then a friend I'd met backpacking in a few places arrived at a hotel the day before me in Phnom Penh and had his phone stolen within 4 minutes of being in the city, losing 3 months worth of photos as he never backed anything up. When I saw him about 2 weeks later he seemed much happier in Vietnam 😂

                In my experience in Vietnam the ppl where way less friendly then in Cambodia haha

                    Siem Reap can go into the deepest depth of hell imo. I found the friendliest people in SEA were for the most part Muslim Malaysian women. They had a curiosity that didn't feel like they wanted something out of me, which is my least favourite trait in people there. Filipinos as well are class - do love them.

                Wow - Im so sad to read this. I had the most incredibly lovely tuk tuk drivers when I was there with my husband and son who was 6 at the time. Maybe the "family dynamic" meant we were shielded from the sex tourism offers. Everyone was just friendly, helpful and kind. You remind me that there were plenty of good things about Morocco - agree that the Atlas mountains were stunning and I loved bustle of all the cities. I just hated being accosted by men all the time and feeling really threatened and unsafe. We were travelling as a group of 4 women in their 20s and attracted way too much attention....

                    Reply:5
                    I think the family dynamic in Cambodia would be a lot more respected than overweight solo white man in their 30s. 

I can see it with Morocco 100% - I have female friends who really don't like it for the same reason. It's almost like Turkey was about 25-30 years ago in attitude.

                        Exactly. I went to Turkey as part of the same backpacking trip but it was after Morocco so we thought it was a breeze in comparison. Same with Egypt…which I think might be more problematic for females to travel in these days than it was in the 90s.

                            I know my dad's always refused to go to Istanbul after a friend of his went in the early 90s and his wife was basically harassed the whole time. Didn't show the enthusiasm when I came back and ranted how good it was, so had to accept it in the end.

                                I really liked Turkey too. I still tell people how awesome the breakfasts were. As a backpacker- paying a dollar for a massive plate of assorted lovely things was just the best. And Istanbul was amazing… I really need to get out and do some traveling again!

As someone who has traveled extensively in these countries, the Philippines stands out as the one place I don't want to return to. Unlike Thailand or Vietnam, the food in the Philippines was really really not great, and everything is significantly more expensive. What you pay there gets you about a quarter of the quality you’d find in Thailand or Vietnam, whether it’s food, accommodation, or goods. After three months, it was the only country where I was genuinely glad to leave. In contrast, Thailand and Vietnam always left me wanting more.

Aside from the beaches, which have mostly turned into crowded tourist traps, there's little that truly sets the Philippines apart. The rural areas are stunning, but you can experience similar beauty in Vietnam. Another aspect that made my experience less immersive was the strong influence of U.S. culture in the Philippines. From media and music to people’s attitudes, much of it mirrors the U.S., which took away some of the magic of discovering a new and unique culture.

Go and experience all three and you will be the judge what you like and don’t like. Each person experience different things visiting there. Some stayed at nice hotel with superb service and some stayed at hostel. If you are willing to go on the same exact trip on things someone else did then it will easy to compare if not then the advices you are seeking won’t justify your experiences.

You can explore the Philippines—there are many undiscovered or underrated spots that, when you see them, may even look more beautiful than the popular or commercialized tourist destinations. I watched this YouTube video, and I’ve been to some of these places as well. I can say they are definitely worth visiting. And Filipino can speak fluent in English so language barrier is not an issue there.

    Most of beggars are Cambodian who illegally come to Thailand, Thai news always report about it. You shouldn’t give them money because it’s supporting human trafficking. Btw about the dogs, at least they have a chance to live while in developed first world countries, if nobody adopt them in time, they gonna be killed.

Congratulations and thank you for the breakdown. I have planned to do this twice in my life, and was very, very close to pull the trigger when I was 30ish, but never went ahead with it. I am now in my early 40s and doubt I will ever have the chance again.

    Reply:1
    Hey now, never say never! We met plenty of travelers on the road that were 40-50s+ It was very inspiring and definitely made me realize we will continue to travel for the rest of our lives. If we do another extended trip, we will probably be about 40 or so when we do it.

        Reply:2
        You are right, but there are several reasons I don't think it will happen for me. I have a dog now and I would never be able to leave her alone for such an extended period. I also believe it will be much harder to find a job after a sabbatical at 45+ than it would be for someone in their early 30s. Last but not least, travel is and will always be a big part of my life. By the time I would have the opportunity for travel long-term, I might not have that many "easy" destinations left, and my ultimate goal is to explore most of what this planet has to offer.

Your liveaboard costs sound really cheap. Were they last minute deals also? Which boats did you go on?

    Reply:1
    The Maldives liveaboard was a deal, yes. We got it 50% off [liveboard.com](http://liveboard.com) and booked it maybe a week or so out. It was $3948 for both of us on the Emperor Serenity, 8d/7n - maybe around 17/18 dives? The vis wasn't as quite as good as we hoped (went in dec) but we saw mantas, a whale shark, and the boat was really, really nice. Definitely our favorite of the two liveaboards. 

The similan islands liveboard in Thailand was not a deal, it was $2353 for both of us on the Mandarin Queen, 5d/4n, 15 dives. We were the only non-asians on this boat, haha. This one was A LOT in a short amount of time, pretty exhausting honestly but Richelieu Rock is gorgeous, so many fish.

Wow, this is truly inspiring. Hats off to you guys for pulling this off. May I ask about the health aspect behind your travel stories, did you get enough rest, were you feeling tired especially during the plane rides. Were you still continuing on with your fitness routines? If you have any tips on how you managed your health during this entire time, it will be really helpful. The day of flying is so exhausting to me and usually the next day is also spent on taking rest. I want to get better at enjoying these too.

    Reply:1
    We were really fortunate that we didn't have any health issues while traveling, other than a few stomach bugs and once I did have a really high fever for a week and that wiped me out. We've always been reasonably fit but didn't really have a fitness routine or anything. We walk A LOT so I'm sure that helped. But I guess our bodies just adjusted to all of the flying?? haha we've always been go go go people and don't have any issues flying then immediately walking somewhere and being active. I always make sure to drink lots of water/apple juice on the plane to stay hydrated, never alcohol while flying. We're also typically in bed by 10pm and make sure to be well rested for activities. 

I would say we started to feel exhaustion from the trip around the time we got to Taipei and did have a lot of rest days through there/Singapore/Thailand/Kuala Lumpur haha We also prioritized comfortable airbnb stays with a couch/good AC etc to make sure we were able to just chill at night if we wanted to.

        Reply:2
        That's so great, thank you for sharing this. I think being that go go go kinda active person helps even more on trips. Sometimes my mind and body just won't cooperate to get up and go 😂 I have felt that being reasonably fit is a such a big requirement for traveling.

    We used a company called Wayfinders Adventures that emails deals out. We bought it 3 weeks out. They also loaned us snow pants and gloves which was helpful since we weren’t coming from home.

Your title says East Asia which is generally used to refer to Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan, and does not include Southeast Asia.

-----------------------------
Comment:
First thing first, South East Asia and East Asia are two different places. East Asia includes China, Japan and Korea. You're going to South East Asia. 

Jakarta is an interesting choice for a first timer to say the least. Alcohol is expensive in Indonesia, so it's good that you're not a drinker. Do check the weather. I think it's the rainy season there in January, possibly the wettest month. 17-day isn't a lot. Bali and Java are also quite far away from the rest of SEA.

If you do mind the rain, fly to KL or Penang then do island hoppings from Langkawi, Malaysia to various islands in Southern Thailand. Fly to Bangkok and end your trip in Jakarta before going home.

    Reply:1
    Sorry, a typo on my part. I’m indeed going to Southeast Asia. 

Yeah, Jakarta has an interesting feedback. People love or hate it or just completely avoid it. I fly in about 5:30 pm and I fly to Jakarta because I got a good deal.

Yeah, that’s not a bad idea. I might check that out. Thanks for the suggestion.

Comment:
If it's your first time in SE Asia, I think it is a bit ambitious. Indonesia is probably not a good place to start and you might be unpleasantly overwhelmed. Thailand has much better tourist infrastructure.

Also, most countries in the world would be hard to check out in 2-3 days as you mentioned you planned for Vietnam. Vietnam is a large country of over 100 million people and a few distinct regions.

I'd recommend you focus on one big city and one chill island destination in a single country with 2 weeks time. Like, fly to Bangkok and check it out for 4-5 days and then do 10 days or so in southern Thailand. Or do something similar in Vietnam.

    Reply:1
    On reflection, I agree with you. It’s probably too ambitious and I probably have factored into how long it takes to get from one city  to another city. I’m based in London and internal flights within Europe and the UK are very quick. 

So what I’m thinking I do a night Inkaar take a plane to Bali for three days Bali to Thailand explore crabby Bangkok maybe one night in Singapore and then back to Jakarta

i don't know if you need to spend that long in jakarta. 

17 days i honestly might just stick to one country or two max. trying to do jakarta, java, bali, bangkok, krabi, singapore *and maybe* vietnam in 17 days is a bit much.

Comment:
I haven't been to Indonesia, but I do love Thailand. I would recommend spending time in Krabi. I loved the place, and you could go Island Hopping and to Railey Beach. All the places are wonderful. Honestly, Singapore is quite small, but there is so much you can do. I loved both of the places!

    Thank you very much my cousin has suggested Chang Mai and Krabi. Will defo check Raleigh Beach looks really nice.

My company has an office in Singapore and my colleague said you could do Singapore in a day.

    My flight actually lands in Jakarta and I’ve got a really good deal from London. I have heard really good things about Java. I don’t know if I have time to go to Lombok. 

I’m hoping to go to the Philippines it just need to work out my route. Happy to be educated on where to go as I’ve no idea about Southeast Asia.

Any tips of Bangkok?  I’ve heard the massages are super affordable.

        Reply:2
        i usually travel one country at a time as i want to fully experience local life! but if you need to pick three for me - indonesia (just because of your flight), thailand, vietnam). 

java if you are interested to go hiking, otherwise go straight to bali! 

for beaches - hands down Philippines - boracay/palawan. Krabi - is nice, Bali is just water(wahahahaha). you go there for the vibe🤣

bali,bangkok, vietnam will spoil you with good food! very cheap! 

Singapore - not my choice as i can go there during layover.

reco - bkk - octave rooftop, tichuca rooftop bar. speakeasy bars - find the photobooth and find the lockerroom. food - wattana panich, phed mark! izakaya type - fatboy🤣

Don't bother spending your short time in Jakarta, I'd head straight down to Bandung or Yogyakarta, then go on from there. Or fly from Jakarta to Medan and explore Sumatra - Sumatra quite awesome IMHO.  Perhaps near the end of your trip you could fly Bali->Singapore, explore Singapore for a day or 2 then fly to Jakarta.

    Reply:1
    OP is already flying all the way from London to Jakarta and arriving in the late afternoon. I think the last thing they would want to do is to immediately get on a train to go straight to another destination.

And Jakarta is a great city to explore for a day or two with plenty to see and do. Fantastic food scene there. Let the influencer cunts stay in Bali or Gili T while those willing to take a step off the beaten path enjoy the delights of the capital.

        Reply:2
        Yes sure there is good food, but that is true of basically everywhere in SEA.  I've spent many weeks in Jakarta, it's not bad, personally I prefer to spend my time in just about any other city in Indonesia.  But I agree after a 20+ hour flight after landing in JKT all I also would want to do is grab a bite have a very long sleep!

    Reply:1
    I land around 5.30pm  Jakarta. Thinking of maybe getting some shut eye after 20+ our flight then head in the morning onwards. I may fly directly to Bali then Thailand. Will do Singapore for a night

My suggested 17 days in SE Asia

Congrats on the good deal flight to Jakarta. Now leave Jakarta 😄 Go spend 3-4 jet lag recovery days in Bali. They also have a major international airport there, so no need to go back through Jakarta for your next stops. 

Bali -> Singapore. I know a lot of people think Singapore is boring. It’s like the Zurich of Asia - but if you’re a foodie, it’s a must-stop. Great food town. 2-3 days in Singapore

Singapore —> Georgetown, Malaysia (Penang). Foodtopia tour continues. 3 days here

Penang -> Phuket/Krabi for 3 days

Phuket -> Bangkok for 3 days

If you’re done now - fly back home. If you had cut back the time a bit (2 days instead of 3, etc) - you may be able to squeeze one more stop in. Do you have to fly back through Jakarta?

    Reply:1
    Thank you for your suggestion. That’s really helpful.

I will spend a night because I arrive at 5:30. I land in Jakarta after a 20+ our flight. 

And your recommendations for places in that you can suggest in Bali. 

I have a few people from a company that work in Singapore so I may catch up with them when I’m there. 

Your itinerary has given me a lot to think about

        Reply:2
        Yeah that’s fair. Get some recovery zzz’s in Jakarta before moving on. 

I’ll let others make Bali suggestions - I tend to be in the “off the beaten path / unplug/ hide from people in the jungle” camp - so someplace like Cepik Villa in Sidemen.  But you might want a more typical beach resort hustle/bustle experience near town. For a trip like yours you might want to alternate between rural and major city. I tend to get burnt out if it’s just city city city

            Reply:3
            Yep and dude what a suggestion. In my head, I just think Bali is a party place. That villa looks amazing and may go ahead and book it.

Looks like a great place just switch off. Silly question what did you read from Bali to get to that villa?

                I just do whatever the New York Times 36 Hours travel column tells me to 😂

Oh - and in Singapore - be sure to try Kaya toast and the vending machine that sells slices of cake in a jar. I’m obsessed with that vending machine.

You don’t necessarily need to “return” to Jakarta to get to Thailand. There are direct flights from Bali to Bangkok and Phuket. So that may free up a day of your itinerary. Still, if you truly intend to “explore” Java and Bali and spend a week in Thailand, you’re not going to have time for a day in Singapore, let alone 2-3 days in Vietnam on top of that. Just count it out: 2 days in Jakarta; at least 2 in Yogyakarta to see the temples and palaces; presumably you then want to hike Mt. Bromo, which will require another 2 based on what I’ve read; now you’re left with 4 days in Bali to allocate however you choose; then a week in Thailand makes 17. Have a great time regardless of what you decide.

    Reply:1
    Thanks for your comments. I think someone suggestions if you like hiking than skin Java. I normally do but limited on time and want to have something more chilled.

Yeah, I’m gonna try and break it down . Maybe a night in Jakarta spend two days in Bali or three days then go to Thailand and then maybe do a day in Singapore.

Thank you once again

        Reply:2
        I’m not sure what they mean by that. Java is huge. There’s plenty of good hiking across the island. Anyway, looking at your responses to other comments, I would suggest taking some time to think about what you really want to see and do on this trip, then map it out using various tools like Google Maps and Google Flights to get an idea of driving distances, flight times, airport locations, etc., and recognizing that every new location will add transit time, planning time, packing time, airport waiting time and more that’ll eat into your actual vacation time. Seventeen days will fly by quickly. Have as much fun as you can.

            Reply:3
            Sorry, a big typo my part. The person mentioned Java is great for hiking and for this trip I’m not feeling like a huge hike basically.

Thank you for the advice and taken fully on board and this is gonna be an amazing trip

    Paris fireworks are at Arc de Triomphe / Champs-Élysées. It gets really crowded and honestly you can’t really see the fireworks if you’re not there a couple of hours early. Got there three hours early last year. Was freezing and couldn’t see much 

Would not recommend anyone to make the trip to Paris just to see the NYE fireworks. It can get really cold and honestly might not end up being worth it

Paris - cold and often pretty gloomy. Phenomenal restaurants if you are really into fine dining. World class art museums.
The city is pretty that time of the year because of the Christmas decorations and then the new year. 
You will be with a local so you should have a great experience with Parisians. 🙄

Thailand - lovely temps as long as you are good with humidity. 
Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket all great in their own ways. 
Very interesting culture, great food, affordable. 
Get a local guide your age to introduce you to the sights but also the non-tourist sides of Thailand - great place to celebrate and play.

You don’t lose either way 🙂

Bangkok for sure. You’ll both go somewhere you haven’t been for the holidays which I think is better. The night life in Paris kinda sucks right now and there are aggy vibes in the club industry atm. (Events being cancelled last minute because of promoter feuds and police being involved etc.) 
I’ve been to all places you mentioned and Thailand is one of my favourite places to visit. The food there is great too. You’ll be able to sightsee more and do more activities.

Had NYE in BKK a couple of years ago. It was fun but book ahead. That year the Main Street party in Koshan Rd was cancelled. The good bars and party’s were all fully booked several days in advance and it’s not as cheap as you might think that night. We still found a good place to be but definitely could have done better with planning earlier. The night markets have all but disappeared now but it’s still super fun, and warm!

Well, one argument for Paris could perhaps be that you could maybe spend some time with your BF's side of the family? That might make it more special in that sense.

Depends on the month. As they are opposite sides of the peninsula, they have different wet seasons.

Thailand I would say food is generally better, or it's easier to get good food. Beaches are better at Samui vs Langkawi. There might be a boat to a Thai island from Langkawi so you could do that as well so you visit both countries.

    The boat from Langkawi takes you to Koh Lipe. It's an extremely small island, but has great scuba diving locations.

        To me.  I liked KL better.  Bangkok was awesome but I hated that as a single man I couldn’t go anywhere after dark without being approached endlessly by ladies of the night and tuk tuks and etc.  KL didn’t have as much cool stuff, but it was less stressful.

            If you are worried about getting approached by LotN, you are hanging around the wrong areas. As for TukTuks, ignoring them works fine. I get just as much hassle down at Bukit Bintang. From hawkers and also plenty of very dodgy LotN

                I mean, I was just in the area around my hotel which is the tourist area.  I was probably four blocks from Soi Cowboy, which is one of the epicenters for sure, but how far away does one need to go?   Bangkok during the day is cool, the food is amazing, but sometimes I just want to go have a beer and people watch without an endless stream of people coming up to me for various reasons. I could get that in KL, not in Bangkok.  I was in the tourist area of both.  It’s cool to disagree man, they are both good cities.

Both options sound fantastic, and it really depends on what kind of experience you're looking for. Having spent time in both Malaysia and Thailand, here’s my take:

**Kuala Lumpur & Langkawi**  
KL is indeed vibrant and full of life. With 48 hours, you’ve probably just scratched the surface. Spending another 2 nights there would give you more time to explore the mix of modern and traditional aspects of the city. From the bustling street markets to the iconic Petronas Towers, there’s plenty to see and do. After that, heading to Langkawi for 5 days sounds like a perfect balance. Langkawi is all about relaxation—beautiful beaches, clear waters, and just the right amount of laid-back island vibe. You can unwind, maybe go for a sunset cruise or explore the mangroves. It’s a great spot if you’re looking to recharge with a mix of nature and serenity.

**Bangkok & Koh Samui**  
Bangkok, on the other hand, is a whole different energy. The city is chaotic in the best way possible, with an endless list of things to see and do—from temples and markets to rooftop bars and street food that’ll blow your mind. Spending 2 nights here will give you a taste of its intensity. Then, moving on to Koh Samui for 5 days offers a nice contrast. Koh Samui is stunning, with its palm-fringed beaches, vibrant nightlife (if you’re into that), and opportunities for some serious relaxation. Whether you want to explore waterfalls, chill on the beach, or even take a day trip to nearby islands, Koh Samui has a lot to offer.

**So, which to choose?**  
If you’re after a bit more variety and don’t mind the contrast between city hustle and beach chill, the Bangkok and Koh Samui combo is hard to beat. You’ll get a mix of culture, food, and relaxation.

But if you’re leaning towards a more laid-back trip with just a touch of city exploration and then a deep dive into beach relaxation, the KL and Langkawi option might be more up your alley. Plus, Langkawi’s quiet charm is perfect if you’re looking to truly unwind.

Both choices are solid, so it really depends on the vibe you’re going for!

Both are awesome but it depends on your vibe tho. I would say Malaysia is super chill w diverse food (nasi lemak, roti canai, curry laksa etc.. ) & cool cities like KL + epic nature (Borneo & Cameron Highlands) while Thailand is all about beaches, parties & temples? great if u r looking for nightlife/ cheap backpacking..

If u want better beaches, head to Thailand for sure. The beach at Langkawi was murky and dirty. The Malays kept blaming the Thais for their dirty beaches which made me roll my eyes. So much trash everywhere. 

langkawi has amazing food…I like both Malay and Thai food so either place food wise  is great

Thailand. FWIW, Malaysia has Shariah law

    Reply:1
    Malaysia is super diverse, especially in Penang and KL there is a huge percentage or Hindus and Christians.

    Reply:1
    The shariah law literally does nothing to foreigners and to the locals? The country use civil law like any other countries in the world, and shariah law mainly consist of marriage, divorce and child custody among muslim couples. And also, Malaysia doesn't work like a middle east muslim country, for example like Afghanistan or Iran where alot things are heavily forced upon the citizen.

In many parts of Phuket and Bangkok, yes, it's absolutely normal. However, that doesn't mean it's normal in all of Thailand.

In Chiang Mai a prostitute jumped on my back and tried to ride me piggyback to my hotel. Then she told me she would “do it for free,” and when I still said no, she said, “Oh, you like boys.”

Lol the soliciting in Thailand is extremely mild. Just learn to say no and keep walking and they leave you alone. It seems more like you are conflating being solicited at all with ‘aggressive soliciting.’

Try going to Egypt or somewhere to find what aggressive soliciting means.

    Yeah the "soliciting" I encountered in Thailand amounted to tuk-tuk guys seeing me walking around and being like "Hey miss you wanna be driven somewhere? No? Okay!"

    Reply:1
    Eh... pretty no one in Egypt will grab you by the junk, which is a regular thing I've had happen in Thailand many times. Ping pong shows are pretty bad, masseuses somehow even worse.

You'll definitely have people follow you down the street more in places like Morocco or Cairo, but it's a.. different kind of soliciting, depending on who you are, where you are, and what is being solicited. 

I've had multiple masseuses lock arms and physically try to pull me into their shops in Phuket, so I definitely don't agree they "leave you alone". You can laugh it off pretty safely (just watch your wallet..), but it happens.

        Asian chicks grabbing my dong is soooooo much better than being followed by Arab men.

            Reply:3
            It's fine — usually more amusing than anything else, and sometimes they're having a bit of a laugh with it. Nothing will happen. It's pretty aggressive soliciting nonetheless, whether you like your dong being grabbed or not. 

Generally speaking, any novelty you think it might have wears off pretty quick when you're just headed out to grab a sandwich and they won't leave you alone.

            Yeah, one is interpretably physical assault, while the other is interpretably harrassment. I'm not saying I'd prefer to be followed down the street, I just don't think it's fair to dismiss soliciting in Thailand as "extremely mild" when I've literally had hands shoved down my pants and been barricaded from moving forward. 

Again, it really depends on who you are, where you are, and what is being solicited. Bangla Road is a totally different world from Khao San.

                    >Yeah you are not being ‘physically assaulted’ by the tiny Thai lady

Race and gender don't generally have any bearing on whether something is physical assault. When walking down Bangla Road at 2AM, you should certainly be *prepared* for this kind of thing to happen, and it is normalized there — but that doesn't make it unaggressive soliciting, nor does it exempt it from being interpretably (as I said before) physical assault. You won't find the same thing happening in *De Wallen* for a reason. 

It's fine, and you get used to it as a tourist. I've been to about a hundred counties, and there's worse stuff in the world. It's still quite aggressive soliciting, by any reasonable definition.

This is really only in the seedy super touristy areas e.g. Khao San Road. Otherwise it tends to be far more relaxed. You might find an occasional hawker but nobody aggressively trying to get you to go to a ping pong show.

I only had maybe 1-2 encounters like this in Bangkok. I was there for 4-5 days. It was very mild in my experience. Even walking through street markets, no one tried to sell us anything. We were able to browse everything very peacefully.

I didn't experience it as much in Thailand, but I did in Bali. But you get better at dealing with them each time you experience it. And they strangely harass you less each time you go - they really zero-in on newcomers somehow

I’m assuming you stayed in very touristy areas. I’ve been to Bangkok twice in the past 5 years. I avoided the seedy touristy areas and didn’t encounter any soliciting at all. I don’t think a ping pong show can even be found in any of the areas I went to.

Normal for tourist area's. During the first month had the same experiences. After one month a friend who was born in Thailand came over to join, from the Netherlands. He thought us one word/sentence and the aggressive shop owners didn't bother us anymore.

The word: mai au (how it is pronounced) which basically means no thank you.

You should try Vietnam.

Absolutely one of my favorite countries to visit. But unless I was in a really secluded bar, I never had a drink or a meal where strangers didn't approach me at me table trying to sell something.

They don't go away after you say no either. You have to ignore them. And the staff won't help you.

As others are saying, it depends where you go - busier tourist places are worse obviously. Wouldn't say they're aggressive though, and I've been all over Thailand. Sure sometimes a bar girl will try and grab your arm and pull you in, or a waiter will walk alongside you with a menu trying to talk you into coming in, but you just have to smile and say no, and keep walking and they'll leave you alone.

Comment:
Just been in SE Asia including Thailand. Bangkok and Hua Hin. Stayed near the river in Bangkok and then in the centre.

No remotely aggressive soliciting in either place (including the weekend market). Basically no soliciting at all unless you include friendly, elderly masseuses calling out “sir, massage?” Tuk tuk guys in Hua Hin were great and generally needed to be waved over. So no - you just went to the absolutely seediest parts of Bangkok and Phuket.

Comment:
Phuket and Bangkok are like this, yes. You chose the wrong areas.

Comment:
My only trip to Thailand was in 1996, so a lot has changed. However, even back then Phuket had a bad reputation, but was and still is the town foreigners often aim for. There are other places in Thailand to consider. Of course even they have become more touristy. Perhaps Ko Samui or Ko Phangan may still be better?

Another place to try is Kanchanaburi, the site of The River Kwai, known more by British than Americans. Again, I'm unsure how it's changed, but there's clearly much more to do there now than when I was there.

-----------------------------
Comment:
100% agree!  I don't know if it's normal for Thailand, but it's normal for Bangkok.  It's one of the things about Bangkok that I actively dislike and one of the reasons that I avoid visiting.  Basically, everyone you meet wants something from you, and solicits it aggressively, and it's very tiring and off-putting.  Yes, this happens in other countries also, but in Bangkok it's an order of magnitude worse.

Someday I hope to visit other cities in Thailand to give them a chance, but I'm done with Bangkok.

Instead of Hue or Da Nang, seriously consider Ninh Binh - even if you just go for 1 full day to experience the scenery. It was one of my favourite places not just in Vietnam, but all of SE Asia. The karst landscape is insane.

        I've visited Vietnam twice, the first time I skipped Ninh Binh so made sure to go there the next time and I am so glad I did.

Also Dalat is one of the coolest places in Vietnam, I've been twice and would happily go again.

If you want a ridiculous day out, visit Ba Na Hills from Da Nang, it's kind of everything I hate but I absolutely loved it.

            Reply:3
            How long did you do Ninh Binh for? Would it be rushed in a day trip?

                Reply:4
                I spent 2 nights there which was a good amount of time to see everything, but you could do it as 1 night stopover between Hanoi and Hue. I really mean Tam Coc when I say Ninh Binh btw, Ninh Binh is the town near it, but Tam Coc is where you want to visit and stay in and the bus stops there. The main things to do is the boat trip and the viewpoint, but I enjoyed just exploring all the different roads and seeing the different temples, caves and landscapes.

Day 1: Bus from Hanoi to Ninh Binh is around 2 hours. Do a boat trip down the river which takes about 2 hours. Wander around Tam Coc, explore a little bit, spend the night.

Day 2: Walk up to the viewpoint, see Mua cave. You can rent bikes or get a short taxi to get here. Explore a bit more, maybe Bich Dong Pagoda. Get on the overnight bus to Hue.

        Bai Tu Bay is part of greater Ha Long Bay. It’s just a little further out. It’s like going to the Grand Canyon but instead of the main parking area where the tour buses are at you go a mile up the road away from the crowds. I did an overnight cruise to Bai Tu Bay. There were maybe another 4 cruise ships there. You can book it while in Hanoi.

        I'd spend about three days in Hoi An. It's quite lovely as a bit of a break from travel hustle with a lot of little side activities to do. Sit by the river, have a beer, relax. Watch the sunset. Very romantic place.

4 days in Bangkok is a lot to be honest. How are you getting around by car or bus? Krabi is a good place to use as a jump off point. Ko phi phi is really a day thing, it’s small…. Plenty of other island around krabi to explore.  Railay is very chill aand offers plenty of excursions

-----------------------------
Comment:
I’d lose a day or two in Bangkok, depending on what time your flight lands/how long your travel day is. I’d lose a day in chang Mai and try and make it out to Pai (northern thailand) for a night or two. Taking a day off in Hanoi and ha long bay, and using that time to travel to Nihn Bihn area (tam coc) specifically. I’d lose a day in da nang 1 night in Da nang is more than enough in my opinion. And I’d lose a day or two in Ho Chi Minh. And I’d use those three days to travel to a little island in the south of Vietnam to chill before the long journey home. Unfortunately I don’t have any recommendations on which island is best.

I'm assuming you're flying between all those locations, otherwise you'll need to modify that plan drastically.   


For Thailand part: Bangkok- Krabi - Chiang Mai is a good order, there are direct flights in-between.   phiphi is a daytrip destination.    


For Vietnam:    


Ha Long - possibly a daytrip or a night on a boat in the bay, definitely not 2 nights there.   


You don't need that much time in Ho chi Minh- I'd recommend just 2 days. It's like Bangkok, but with worse everything.

    Reply:1
    Yeah flying is the main thing. Figured domestic flights with a backpack wouldn't be too much a ball ache!

Phi Phi is now a day trip and it's looking like Ha Long is a nightboat, but undecided between that and day trip.

 Thanks for your help, and the "worse everything" made me laugh!

5 days in Da Nang and Hoi An is way too much IMO. 2 full days is enough IMO.

I would work in one full day in Ninh Binh.

    Reply:1
    Ninh Binh has definitely been fit in now. I have removed Da Nang all together, with Hoi An being two days. Is that the right move or any other places in Viet more with that time, in your opinion?

-----------------------------
Comment:
3 nights in Hoi An is a night too long in my opinion. It's pretty small. 1-2 nights is enough.

I would keep all four nights in Bangkok to start the trip because it's a big city with a lot to see and because you will be jet lagged for the first 1-2 days.

I personally don't think Chiang Mai warrants four nights but some people do, and you may be arriving late on the first day if coming from Koh Phi Phi.  I'm seeing one nonstop flight from Krabi  to Chiang Mai and it leaves at 7pm.

    Reply:1
    Yeah Hoi An has been changed to 2 nights now. Exactly my thoughts with Bangkok. Based on what people have said, it looks like Phi Phi is a daytrip now so that makes it easier flight wise :) With the new days opened up, where else in Thailand would you suggest? Any other islands or cities?

        Reply:2
        Well to me the most impressive thing to see in the region is Angkor Wat. There are direct flights from Bangkok to Siem Reap, and there are direct flights from Siem Reap to Hanoi on Vietjet Airlines and Vietnam Airlines.

If you take a day out of Chiang Mai, Hoi An, and Phi Phi, you could fit in three nights in Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples like Beng Melea and Koh Ker.

Like others have said, shave a day off of Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and HCMC each. I would replace Ha Long with Cat Ba island. Same vibes, little quieter. Ninh Binh and Ha Giang are good north Vietnam things to replace the city time as well

    Reply:1
    All of those things have applied, thanks. Ninh Binh is a definite now, however I'm just not sure Ha Giang loop is for me, risk wise. Do you suggest anywhere else to fill the time? Thanks!

        Reply:2
        For Ha Giang, you can get easy riders, and join a tour with a local driving you around. Much safer that way, that's what I did. 


A little harder to get to, but quite beautiful is the Cao Bang Provence, and the Ban Gioc Waterfall. There are 1-2 day tours that you can arrange with your hostel to see that and other stuff in the region 


Near Hue is Phong Nha, which has massive caves and dense jungle  to explore


SaPa is the place for rice paddy hikes and what not. A little touristy, but that's ok. 


Khao Sok Lake in Thailand is quite nice as well


Siem Riep in Cambodia has Angkor Wat, the most impressive ruin complex anywhere in the world. It can be done via overnight busses between Bangkok and HCMC, but flights might be easier. 


Please check the annual weather ahead of time for wherever you go. Phong Nha is flooded for 2 months of the year, Ha Giang is having landslides due to rainy season right now

When you say nature, what kind of things are you looking for? We snorkeled in the Surin islands, visited the Doi inthanon national park, and visited an elephant sanctuary (no riding). You're spending a lot of time in cities; do you want to be out in nature more?


Also at that time, you're right to go to the Andaman sea side of Thailand in the south. The Gulf area has more rain at that time.


The best food we had was in Chaing Mai, Hanoi, and Saigon. Have bun cha in Hanoi if you eat pork - it was amazing!!

    Thanks for the suggestions. I've since added Ninh Binh and Khao Sok to the itinerary to try and even things out! I think there's an elephant sanctuary in Khao Sok 😄

        Up to you of course. There are also sanctuaries in Chiang Mai, Koh Samui, and others. Many beautiful elephants to be rescued unfortunately!

Comment:
How are you getting between these places exactly? Have you structured the cities this way for a specific reason? 

You've chosen a lot of big cities, I see, which is fine if that's what you like. I understand the desire to move a lot and see a lot, but you should consider the amount of time you lose by trying to move too often. Time in transit, to and from, time checking in, packing and moving hotels, etc.

Ha long bay is pretty underwhelming, Imo. If you must, just book a day trip from hanoi. Da nang isn't bad but it's not special. In the end, you'll enjoy it no matter what you choose, I'm sure, so no worries, but after a month there, ninh binh was by far the best place I saw. I'd recommend three days there. You could cut hue, da nang, or a couple days from HCMC. 

Ko phi phi is pretty, like Krabi, but it's just like a small Ibiza type thing. The over night trip to phi phi leh is nice, but that's about it. You could save time by skipping it and hitting Koh Phang an before Krabi instead for the full money party, which is more memorable. Turn just fly from Krabi to CM.

    Reply:1
    It's mainly been for the fact that you can fly between them fairly cheaply and easily, and through what my research has deemed the 'have to do' things in these countries. Hence why I wanted to see what everyone had to say. Thanks for the tips!

I wouldn’t call any of those heavily touristed places “relaxing” if that’s what you’re looking for.

    Reply:1
    Yeah I agree, we’re not looking for a \*fully\* relaxed mode; we enjoy exploring cities as well. We chose Da Nang to include the option of relaxing on the beach/hotel while still having time to explore other attractions in the area

Vietnam is absolutely worth the trip! An amazing country. We were there for a week and it wasn't enough time! Already thinking about going back. Hanoi is chaotic. Its Asia on hard-mode. Amazing all the way through, but i would not call it relaxing. I would skip Ha Long Bay. We found it crowded and dirty, kind of depressing. Consider Tam Coc- often called Ha Long bay on land. We did both and loved Tam Coc way more. You can rent a car to bring you, its very easy. Just ask your hotel or I can PM you someone we used.

Danang and Hoi an are very close together, maybe just 5 days for the whole thing would be enough.

You can add in somewhere else perhaps, maybe Dalat, or Nha Trang, or Sapa valley, or Phu Quoc for some beach time.

No need for HCMC really.

I highly recommend Vietnam, Happy Travels!

        Agree w the comment that 8 nights in HA and DN is probably long, given the length of the trip..  I'd  add the two nights during your return turn trip to Ha Noi and use those two nights in Ninh Binh (but you can probably get away w one).  That said, if you want to stay at a nice resort in Da Nang for some R&R such as the Hyatt Regency or Intercontinental, and add day trip to Hue, that probably works too.  They're away enough from the busy city but has direct beach access.  Have a great trip.  You'll have a great time regardless.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Hoi an at most is 2 days 1 night

-----------------------------
Comment:
I would combined danang and hoian into 1 since they are next to each other, or maybe hue id you into history. Hue is top destination for food that you cant find anywhere else. 
And add ho chi minh or southern mekong if you can. The experience will totally be different from north to south.

-----------------------------
Comment:
It's a common itinerary like any tour operator would offer. It's likely to be "checkboxes" rather than "relaxed" as you said. In my opinion, you should cut four days from Hoi An and Danang to HCMC due to their proximity.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Shorten Hanoi two days at least, shorten Hoi An a day or two , skip Da Nang or just see the important stuff like Marble mountain on way to Hoi An.  Add Ho Chi Minh for a few days and add Hue a few days.  My two cents.  But don't miss Vietnam.

I would hate doing that trip with a suitcase (even Rome would be a pain never mind on and off buses and trains and across uneven paths) and with a day sack as well I would go for the 55l backpack. It will be plenty. But I have never travelled with a suitcase and detest them so am very biased!

-----------------------------
Comment:
I would pack in a carry on backpack (30-40l). No risk of lost luggage, quicker to check in and leave the airports, easier to carry around, and doesn't take much space in a hotel room (and rooms in Japan are tiny). 

Lugging a huge suitcase across 6 countries seems exhausting to me but people have different preferences so you need to figure out what works for you.

If you have a good back, a backpack would be easier to carry around. If your back is messed up, take a suitcase. Also keep in mind that if you plan to take or being back anything breakable, a hard sided suitcase is better. You can also get one of those fold up  rollable luggage carts if needed.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Backpack.  Years back I hooked up with a girl in a hostel in SEA and we ended up traveling around together for about six weeks, she had a rollie suitcase and it was a major pain in the ass for her (and for me since I ended up helping her with it a lot).  The sidewalks are shit, the sides of the crowds can be crowded with scooters and whatever else, there can be gross shit on the ground, go with a backpack 100%.

-----------------------------
Comment:
The two things my wife and I count every day we go out for our walks are bandaged knees (scooter accidents from people who don't bother to learn how to ride in their own country before going to SEA) and wheels torn off of luggage laying on the side of the road or walkway.

I highly recommend using a backpack. Then again, I also recommend keeping the packed weight below 7-kg, as it saves your back, as well as time and money with transportation.

Boracay is tiny. I think after a few days, you'd get bored.

I just spent 3 weeks in Panglao/Bohol, and loved it. Rented a scooter and drove up to the Chocolate Hills. Plenty of great bars and such too keep you entertained in Alona,and the airport is right there, just a few minutes away,and it has flights from Clark, so you can completely avoid Manila. The beaches aren't as lovely as boracay, but they are still lovely.

Palawan El Nido and Coron, has the awesome tropical waters.  Good side trip. 

The bar scene in Thailand is far better than PH.   With the exception of Angeles City, but thats for men only, as it has over 100 girly bars.  It caters to Korean, Japanese, European, Aussie , and of course the American military men.  

Boracay bar scene is small but if you look on satellite google maps, there are several bars along the main beach.

Boracay is probably the most beautiful beach and sea that I have been to. We stayed towards the south which was a bit outside of the busy area. It was also before the government shut the island to tourists for a bit so I assume it is even cleaner now?? But maybe that also affected the other hospitality businesses. We did 3/4 days after touring Luzon and Bohol. I wouldn't stay there for 10 days but that is a personal preference.

I have been to Boracay, it’s beautiful but there isn’t enough for ten days. I did five nights over an Easter a few years ago whilst working in Manila. So it was an inexpensive trip for me because of that.

    In our case it's 3 flights each direction and its quite a hassle to be honest, manageable but a hassle nonetheless.

Comment:
I spent a month in the Philippines a few years ago including a few days in Boracay over NYE. Big party scene but the island is pretty small so 10 days would be overkill. There's lots to do on Palawan and Cebu so I'd maybe split the 10 days between those. But also factor in that getting from island to island can be a bit to navigate.

Comment:
You should consider season/weather which will impact how you're able to enjoy the areas. I would think 5-6 days for Sydney, Melbourne and maybe Cairns is a stretch. I feel Cairns is more so a base for excursions into the surrounding areas  so you would need a vehicle or do tours, whereas Sydney and Melbourne you can just get out of your accommodation and explore the city using public transport.

Why so many different islands? Are you aware of how much traveling you need to do to see all of this? And how are you traveling? 

In 6 weeks you can see pretty much every highlight in Thailand. I'd swap a few islands for Khao Yai and Erawan.

    We love islands but yes I’m concerned it might be too much. Planning on using all forms of transport. Will definitely have a look at khao yai and Erawan. Thank you 🙏

        Reply:2
        All forms of transportation is a bit vague. I suggest looking at 12go.asia and have a look at how long it takes to get from one island to the next. With your schedule you spend at least 2 weeks of your holiday on ferries and taxis.

Hello! I just came back from my 4 week thailand travel. I think its too many island, but you can be spontaneous. I would highly recommend Koh Phangan, my partner and I liked this island the most, because its full of nature and exploring things. I can also recommend "The Pier" you sleep in your own bungalow right next to the ocean (not the most beautiful beach, but a very nice feeling in my opinion) you can also rent scooters there for like 7€ per day, which makes the exploring way easier. We also did not like bangkok, 2 nights were enough for us, its very very busy. I personally did not see chang mai or generelly the north of thailand, but every local we talked to recommended us to go there. Hope this helps :)

    Reply:1
    Thank you so much - this is so helpful. Would you mind sharing your itinerary?

        Reply:2
        sure! we started at bangkok and stayed two nights. Then we went to Hua Hin, but this was just because we travelled low budget and did not want to take a flight, was not that beautiful so i would not recommend it (stayed there 3 nights). After that we went to Krabi and stayed there over a week because I had to go to the hospital. I  can recommend the COSI Hotel 10€ per night per person, they have a rooftop pool, you can do your laundry there and the rooms are beautiful for this price. After this we went to Koh Phi Phi. We did not like it there, its full with tourists and a very small island, you can do great snorkeltrips there but thats it (in my opinion). Then we went to Koh Phangan for 1 week. Then to Koh Samui for 5 nights, but this was also very touristic in comparison to koh phangan. Then we took a flight to bangkok and stayed there 2 nights, because our flight home went from bangkok. We also heard only good things from Koh Tao! But did not make it because I was Ill for a week. I wisj you a great time in Thailand and be aware of scams in bangkok!

                Ko Tao is the best island in Thailand. Defo make space for it. 

My Thailand itinerary last April was a bit stupid though, far too much travelling and some places weren't the best. I didn't like Koh Lanta personally, found it deathly quiet without much to do apart from the national park.

Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Krabi, Phuket, Ko Phi Phi, Ko Lanta, Ko Samui, Ko Phangan, Ko Tao, Krabi fly Chiang Mai (purely for price of flights from Ko Samui v. Boat and flight from Krabi).

                    Thank you so much! Have heard amazing things about koh Tao so we definitely going there. We will be diving too. I’m going to cut out some places as I now realise it’s too much travelling.

                        Reply:6
                        It's doable, but it's almost doable for doables sake.

Chiang Mai/Pai/Rai is certainly doable in a week or 9 days. 

Bangkok, probably a 2 night jobby - it's not my favourite city if I'm honest. 

Ko Samui/Phangan/Tao are relatively close together and you can spend 9 days or 3 weeks there depending on how much you like it.

Krabi is quite nice, Railay is only 20 mins from Ao Nang and you can have a day trip there without missing much - although the sunset there is stunning.

That seem like a lot of different islands, and an island is an island... From what I know the first route is wacky, like going from Pha Ngan to the "Trat" islands is not ideal, so it's either the Krabi and down there island, or the around Trat ones.

1st: If you do the "Trat" ones you can hop to Cambodia for Angkor Wats (best temple complexe you'll see in Asia or even in the world IMO) and arguably better islands (or what used to be ?) away from Sihanoukville (I loved North Koh Ta Kiev, felt like Thailand before the 00's with bambou huts and no electricity), really liked Koh Rong too, but it was turned into a chinese casino disaster I heard ? I loved Koh Chang but it got very "russian"/build up now, didn't do the smaller ones, heard tales of sandflies and those monsters like me too much to even try...

Alternative route for 1st: start from Chiang Mai, than from Chiang Rai go to Luang Prabang in Laos on a Mekong 2 days "cruise", Luang Prabang (and Laos in general) is amazing, than continue down to Vientiane via Vang Vieng, and from there to the Trat region (make a stop in Angkor "on the way") to end up by the relaxing beaches after all the visiting. (and like that you avoid unnecessary planes rides)

2nd: If you go south, you have to take into consideration that some islands are bigger with stuff to see on it, and other are just island life. Tao have great restaurants and Padi training but not much else (lot of shallow waters beaches). Pha Ngan is part too family friendly/ part too party vibe, and beware of the life ruining sandflies ! On the other side I didn't like Lanta that much (large beaches with no shades lined with restaurants/hotels, some nice "untouched" one to the south but not crazy beautiful), great food tho. I liked Pipi even if very crowded in the day time with tours, my personal favorite was tiny Kradan, the most beautiful paradise type views I had in all around Thailand, but the food is not great (at least for the thai, it's mostly italian) and accommodation is expensive for what you get (used to have cheap bungalows far north but they closed during the pandemic from what I know). And controversial but I didn't care for Krabi...

For the north I really liked going after Pai to the Myanmar border, to Mae Hong Song, but I had a lot of time.

Great site for infos [Travelfish.org](http://Travelfish.org)

Have a great trip !!

    Reply:1
    Wow thank you so much, this is so helpful and has really made me rule out my 1st itinerary as we unfortunately have to start our route in Krabi as spending a week there with family for Christmas until we off on our own. From northern Thailand we actually going to Laos as we travelling in total for 3.5 months. Will look at kraden and thinking of skipping lanta and lipe now then continuing with the 2nd itinerary.

        Reply:2
        Oh that's great ! In Laos I really liked the tiny village of Muang Ngoi Neua, only accessible by boat but with great food and bungalows in lush gardens on the river, the views on the mountains from your hammock are to die for, with tiny wooden villages on rice fields in close distance, I heard they got a road now tho, and probably changed a bit...

If it's your first trip there: be carful with your bags in thai buses, don't let anything of value in your big checked ones and lock them up, they get looked into during the trip pretty often, even - especially - on luxury bus companies, by the "helpers"

But it's just amazing, easy to travel, cheap, people are fantastic (as long as you respect them), beautiful architecture and sceneries, incredible food, you're going to love it so much ! Enjoy !

I would pick 2 islands (3 at most) so you can actually enjoy each place you go.  It is exhausting to pack travel, unpack, pack travel, etc.  With only 48 hours or so in each place.


What is it you hope to get our of this trip?  History, relaxation, culture, excitement.  That will determine where to go.  Thailand is an amazing country.


One suggestion if it's your first time in SE Asia:  from Bangkok fly into Siem Reap one morning and see Angkor Wat.  Stay 1 night, see more of the temples and fly back that evening to Bangkok or another location.

Initial thoughts: It would be a damn shame to fly into Phuket and not see Krabi and Ko Phi Phi if the weather is decent, especially as it’s low season and not mobbed with tourists. 

Flying into Cambodia to see Phnom Penh and not Angkor Wat is literal insanity. Not that the killing fields aren’t worth visiting if you are in PP, but there’s not exactly a lot to see w/o your imagination, and not really worth going way out of your way to get to.

Burning season is fine, I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you have major respiratory issues, in which case you shouldn't be travelling to SEA anyways. That said, you could consider going to Koh Samui or Koh Tao instead, just to see a different side of the island culture.

    Reply:1
    Thank you for this. When you say different side of island culture, can you elaborate on what you mean please? Would it really feel different to Krabi? (which I appreciate is technically mainland not island)

        Reply:2
        I don't think it would feel super different, but it depends on what/where you book. It's just another place to see, it wouldn't necessarily be a drastic difference. Krabi itself is very textured and has everything from partying, to national parks, to isolated resort life, so you need to choose your own adventure here. The Koh Samui - Koh Tao chain of islands is similar, there's a lot of choice in what your experience could be. Partying, diving, quiet resorts, nature, etc. 

If you want a drastic difference, you might want to consider Malaysia, it seems to be a very common option for people making their way to Krabi — I haven't done Malaysia though, personally.

I had the same thing last March, idea was to go Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket (as was meeting friends who were flying in from Oz and UK).

Instead I went to Krabi after Bangkok and then went to Chiang Mai a few months later in May. 

If you can do it, I would prefer Vietnam over Cambodia in every way however for 4 days, it might be good to pop over to Siem Reap and see Angkor Wat.

    Reply:1
    Considered Siem Reap, but also hearing how March is too hot for it so not sure!

  
Where in Vietnam would you recommend?

        Reply:2
        Vietnam's my favourite country in the world, so it's pretty much an open book. I think North Vietnam is the most spectacular scenery I've seen, particularly Sapa and Ha Giang. Hanoi is a fantastic city as well. The issue is it's 6 hours drive from Hanoi to Sapa, so if you have 4 days then it's probably not going to be worth the visit.

SEA is hot generally in March, and Cambodia rarely gets cold in that time of year, but for 4 days I think it's worth doing that visit, as it is a stunning place - and I'm not generally a fan of Cambodia.

                Reply:4
                Hoi an is a lovely town, with a beautiful river and is quite a relaxing place compared to Hanoi. The old town is very easily one of the more chilled out spots I've seen in Vietnam.

Da Nang I only spent an evening in because I was flying out the next day. Went to Asia Asia park at night and was one of about 10 people in a theme park. Felt like a Scooby Doo character. 

Hue I'd love to actually properly visit, but apart from telling you I bought a coffee in between buses which was very nice, I can't say much other than what I've seen on TV.

We absolutely loved Chiang Rai--so much to see and do and there were far fewer tourists there.

    How many days can you fill up with Chiang Rai? Also wondering if it may still have burning season issues possibly

-----------------------------
Comment:
5 days is too little for Phuket, Ko Phi Phi and Bangkok. Just skip Phuket. Even if you have extra days it would be better to stay in Krabi province which is much closer to Ko Phi Phi than Phuket and where you can make day trips to truly beautiful beaches and islands like Railay beach, Ko Hong and Ko Poda.

For a Brazilian person, Phuket’s beaches aren’t much to write back home.

    Reply:1
    Seconding the recommendation for Krabi. I did Krabi first, Phuket second, and kept thinking about how much better Krabi was. Nicer food, better sights, cheaper prices...

    Reply:1
    Thank you for the info. Is it worth it doing Krabi first and then Bangkok or it doesn’t matter?

        Reply:2
        they are totally different places so it doesn’t really matter. But given that you are probably flying back home from Bangkok I guess it makes more sense to leave Bangkok for last.

BKK to BNE runs nonstop Tuesday Thursday and Saturday during those months. Right there on Google flights. But clicking on the flight into Jetstar's website throws an error.

I'd try to call and see if they can see the flights and ask them to book you on it no charge cause their website is messed up. The travel agencies like Kiwi and Trip show it bookable too. I'm not saying do that, but I'm just providing evidence. Book with Jetstar.

Why go to Singapore for 1 night?  Seems like such a waste of time and money. i mean 7 day in Thailand is not that much, think I spent 2 weeks there and could have spent much longer.  I spent 4 days in Singapore, can do it in 3 days IMO.....1 night there is a waste.

Why Phuket?  Think there are a ton of better options.

I have not been to Thailand, but spent 5 full days in Singapore and not even that was sufficient to see everything. It's an amazing city. If I were you, I would either do a trip to Singapore with a possible day trip to Malaysia or Indonesia, or just focus on Thailand and leave Singapore for another time.

My wife and I are planning a trip to Southeast Asia for 3 months. This trip will be our first time backpacking and our first time getting travel insurance. I am trying to figure out what I should input for the cost of the trip. I understand that only non-refundable expenses apply, and this is where I need clarification. Our only non-refundable expense is our round-trip flight from the US to Hong Kong. After that, we are just going with the flow. We plan to visit Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, but we don't have anything else booked and probably will not book anything until a few days before we do it.

 

I'm not super concerned with filing a claim to get reimbursed for our travel or accommodations on the trip, but I do want medical and emergency transportation. For instance, if our flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed for some reason, we'd make the most of it and enjoy another day in Phuket.

 

So is it possible to get only the medical portion of travel insurance, and if not, what should I put down for "the cost of the trip"?

Get the travel medical insurance for the whole 3 months. You should use a travel credit card with travel insurance to cover the individual segments during your trip.

    Reply:1
    Can you elaborate on how the credit card travel insurance works?

        Reply:2
        Each travel credit card that offers travel insurance will have a certificate of insurance that explains what is covered, what is excluded and how to make a claim. You'll need the terms and conditions of the Cardholder Agreement and certificate of insurance to understand how travel insurance works for that card. Usually it involves filing a claim online, submitting a lot of documents and waiting weeks to get compensation.

        Reply:2
        An example would be car rental insurance. Because I use my travel card (I have the Venture X but it applies to Amex, chase, etc) I don’t pay for rental insurance from the rental company. I make a claim through my card. The same goes for lost luggage, reimbursement for delays, etc.

But each card is different and has slightly different perks.

            Reply:3
            I've been reading on credit cards forum that the one though your credit card isn't what people think it is.  But that the ones where you pay an annual fee & Venture cards, Amex are better.

I have a CapitalOne Savor that offers it but also only gives 1%.  I was going for BofA Travel card but seems like they don't really cover anything or as much.

                Reply:4
                Yes, you want an actual travel credit card. I’ve used the rental car insurance and it paid for a new windshield no questions asked. You get the annual fee back in perks so don’t let that scare you away.

                    Reply:5
                    Yeah I think my Savor card does that too, but I'm not getting a rental on this trip.  Thanks.

Not worth flying into Jakarta. I'd look at Yogyakarta (for Borobudur and Prambanan) and then maybe Mt Bromo and Ijen on the way to Bali. Bali also has a good volcano climb if Rinjani is not enough (Mt Agung). Don't underestimate it.

Even though it's the tropics these mountains are BIG. It frequently gets below freezing on Mt Bromo so come prepared if trekking is your aim.

    That’s good to know thank you. If you’ve hiked these mountains before, do you think a good pair of trail runners will be enough, or are hiking boots a must?

If your itinerary is set in stone and you definitely want to visit both Ha Long and Ninh Binh then add the extra day to Hanoi. Ha Long Bay takes up 2 days, Ninh Binh is another full day, so with the extra day that gives you at least some time to actually see Hanoi.

If you haven't booked anything yet then I would seriously rethink this whole trip. 2 nights in each place in Thailand isn't even worth it in my experience, all you're gonna do is be travelling the whole time and not get to do anything fun. If the weather isn't on your side then it can basically ruin your whole trip as you have no flexibility. The best thing about travelling in Thailand is just how easy it is to change up your plans and make last minute decisions. I'd ditch Vietnam completely and just go to Bangkok, an island or 2, then Chiang Mai, which will definitely keep you busy for 2 weeks.

    Reply:1
    Only the flight into Bangkok and flight out of Hanoi are set. 

Currently I have 3 nights in Bangkok and CM and 4 in Hanoi, just hopping around islands more. Yeah it might be tight but from how many activities and doing early flights+ferries it might be doable?

        Please stay for a few days. It’s a small island but what a vibe. Find a place close to the chaweng beach. That street is really nice. Would also recommend visiting coco tams one of the evenings for fire show at 7.30 pm. 

I’ve visited Thailand a few times, and, now I just want to simply fly into Koh Samui only. It’s just amazing. 🤩

Koh Chang is in Trat, so you would need an internal flight from Bangkok. Recommend the Chivapuri if you choose Koh Chang. Other possibilities are Koh Tao or Koh Jum for less touristy places. If you want to go somewhere close to Phuket then Koh Yao Yai or Noi, but they are getting expensive these days. The Vijitt in Phuket is lovely, but the sea goes out for miles at low tide leaving a kind of muddy sludge, that said they have a lovely pool or pool villas

    Reply:1
    can’t you drive to the pier to get to koh chang? google maps says about 4 hours to the quay. we would prefer a place with great beaches

        Reply:2
        Yes you can take a car from Bangkok but it is quicker to get a Bangkok Air flight to Trat (which is a lovely tiny airport) and get a private transfer to Koh Chang (they drive you on the ferry and to your hotel on Koh Chang, ferry costs extra though). I am assuming you will fly into BKK and Bangkok air flies from there. More info here https://kohchangferries.com/private-transfer-car-minibus/  great beaches depend on what you like. Chivapuri has a good beach, sea may be a bit cloudy in January though. The best beach I ever found in Thailand was on Koh Lipe, but the island is too developed and there is broken glass in the sand on the main beaches. Best hotel there with a beach without glass was Serendipity, but also not cheap

            Reply:3
            Ok, we are flying from Sieam Reap, so yes we are flying into Bangkok

Look at Koh Jum. I’ve taken my kids there twice - it’s quiet, calm, pretty, very low-key. Accessible via ferry from Krabi. Or if you want somewhere bigger, stay on the boat to Koh Lanta. Plenty for kids to do but still peaceful. Koh Chang is definitely more touristy. Or if you’re set on Trat, look at Koh Kood / Kut. Beautiful spot, amazing beaches, and smaller / calmer than Koh Chang.

Phuket Marriott Resort & Spa, Merlin Beach

The beach is just okay there--going in the water the corral is harsh on the feet and water was rough at times but the resort pools were great and you can easily take a car into town nearby for dinner, etc.  Not fancy, but decent and affordable.  Many other beaches nearby if you want to check them out too.  A bunch of places around there will advertise "great beaches" but they frankly don't look that great compared to the islands.  For kids to play in the sand and use the pool, it should be good though.

Be aware that going from Cambodia to Phuket can be hard to find direct flights and you often need to go through Bangkok, which makes what should be a short trip, longer than you would expect.

Alternatively, take the train to Hua Hin from Bangkok

Great honeymoon destination!

I would recommend a mix of adventure destinations and relaxing areas.

Phuket could be a good base, but I'm personally not a huge fan of the area - quite touristy, but the comfort in that might suit!

You could use Phuket as a base (probably where you'll find the best street food, after Bangkok), and depending on how long you have, you could visit:
- Khao Sok national park
- Koh Lanta (very relaxing beachy island)
- Koh Tao (beachy, but more touristy)
If I could only pick one, I'd stay at a nice villa in Koh Tao and alternate between relaxing days at beach bars and slightly more adventurous walks or trips to other beaches.

For cash, check your bank/card fees for ATM and international transactions. Most likely outcome is you'll be best to take out a lot of cash at a good international ATM (they usually let you take the most out). You can do this at the airport when you also get a Sim card.

For the electrical plugs, generally the US plug is accepted. Some places may only have a EU style plug, so perhaps consider bringing a converter. Be sure to check any chargers you bring are rated to 220V, since US is 110V (though most products can handle 110-240V.

Hope this helps!

If you’ve never left the US, Phuket is a great start. Yes, it’s touristy for Thailand, but way less touristy than Cancun. Lots of great hotels and resorts right on the beach, INCREDIBLE food, nice people. Don’t stay in Patong, it’s kinda gross, but good to go there for a night for food market. There are ATM’s all over the place. There’s a cash exchange place in the old town right around the corner from the Sunday night market that has great rates (never change money at the airport). There are a lot of night markets, some have different vibes but generally sell the same stuff. There’s a super fancy designer mall (LV, Gucci, etc) in Phuket if you want something high end. There are so many incredible day trips you can take. If you stay somewhere other than the old town and Patong, it’s not overrun by tourists and you can have a really good time. Enjoy!

Phuket is very touristy. If you wanna go where the locals go, try Hua Hin. If you’re looking to splurge - Naka Island. 

ICONSIAM for shopping, but honestly, there are tons of malls in Bangkok. If you’re looking for clothes, try Platinum Fashion Mall. Chinatown has some great street food, but honestly, just about anywhere is good. 

I just bring cash (get newer $100 bills as Thai banks exchange places won’t accept old ones). You get a better exchange rate exchanging $100s vs $20s. Use a credit card that doesn’t haven’t foreign transaction fees, but be prepared to mostly pay w/ cash if you’re not in malls, hotels, or major food chains. Also use Superrich Money Exchange away from the airport. They generally have the best rates. 

As for phone chargers, they have regular outlets like the US. I had no issues. 

Sorry for the long post. I love Thailand. Planning on retiring there. It also helps my girlfriend is Thai 🤣🤣

For an American who’s never been abroad, Phuket (and Bangkok) are ideal. Phuket has a tourist path paved. Restaurants will have English menus. (You can also search for local food.) Hotels and tour guides speak English, to answer your questions. Plenty of adventure but easy to navigate.

A lot of hotels have universal outlets now so any plug shape works. (Note there’s a difference between having the right prong shape and having the right voltage.) Also, a lot of hotels have adapters you can borrow. Email the hotel in advance to ask for a picture of their outlets, if you want to be sure.

Advice on food. Tourist restaurants modify the flavors and spiciness levels toward a western palate. I prefer local food. I look for a no-frills restaurant (no aesthetic vibes), but with a few Thai customers. Our best meal last time was at outdoor restaurant stalls with plastic stools/tables, open-air but under a tin roof. Shanty vibes but the food was amazing (and genuinely spicy!).

We liked Phuket and stayed at 5 star Hotel called Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.  In May 2017, we paid about $110 a night.  I just looked and current May 2025 rates that include their huge buffet breakfast start about $135USD.  We had pre-arranged for the hotel to pick us up at airport for about $40 for the 40-45 minute ride to the hotel, but you might hire a Grab taxi for less; download the Grab app.
The property is beautiful and surrounded by lush mountains that extend into the water on each side so the beachfront is private.  There is a grill and bar near the beach for food and drinks too.  Besides the fantastic buffet breakfast in their main dining area, there are several other restaurants on the property.  One restaurant is located on an area that extends into center of the pool area; this has a buffet dinner and music entertainment for a reasonable fee.  We used ATMs I think to get Thai baht or we exchanged our cash at the hotel front desk.  Take newer date clean crisp  bills as their banks are picky, so some vendors won’t take US bills with any folds or marks on them.  
We took a cheap taxi into nearby town to do some touristy shopping and were told their nightlife there was lively but we aren’t into drinking/partying so we left before dark.  There are several local food places to eat at too.  The hotel can probably help you arrange tours to see the Thai sites or go to different nearby beaches or towns.  We were only there 2.5 days after our son’s wedding and we so enjoyed staying at the Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort.

Another place we absolutely LOVE is Hoi An, Vietnam!  Plan to stay minimum of 4 days here.  It is great and sooo inexpensive and enchanting with all the lanterns that they are known for!  To get to Hoi An, fly to DaNang (see Dragon bridge and Hands bridge while there).  If you have time, do both Bangkok, Thailand and Hoi An, Vietnam while you are over there since flights between areas of Asia are very reasonable with Vietnam Airlines or Viet Jet. March and first part of December is good time to go to Hoi An for best weather but this place is beautiful all year and much to do.  Fall is their wet monsoon season so plan accordingly.
We stayed at Bel Marina Resort there recently (for 2nd time) which is located on a river for $94/night includes huge buffet breakfast; excellent service and accommodations.  Be sure to tell them it is your honeymoon ahead of time and you’ll likely get a free room upgrade.  Tell them Cynthia and Charles Petri sent you!  It was our 50th Anniversary and they gave us free upgrade and other special things.  Our “king” bed was size of two full size beds together; and had a balcony facing the pool.  It is a 5 minute walk or take a complimentary hotel bike to old town Hoi An for great local food (Bahn Mi sandwich rolls, Cao Lau, and Chicken Rice and spring rolls) and neat local crafts shopping (lanterns, custom leather goods, tailor shops, pop-up greeting cards at $1.40 each, Lulemon crossbody bag knock-offs for $5, silk sewn pictures, and beautiful abilone/shell decorated trivets and trays ($3 for 7” size trivet) for example. All shopping is negotiable!  
Be sure to book an evening boat cruise (light dinner with 2 cocktails) from the Bel Marina  included setting out a floating wish candle.  
We also recommend going to see the excellent Hoi An Memories Show (about $40-45 a person) across the Moon bridge (hotel can arrange it), which features a large outdoor beautiful production story about Hoi An’s beginnings with about 400 actors and special lights and effects.  Several free Mini pre-show performances begin about 5pm on different areas of the entertainment grounds so go early if you want to see these performances before the 7pm main show.  
Book a tour at the Silk Village to see the hands-on silk worm growing and processing to make silk fabric; so interesting.  
You’ll see gold-colored fancy covered golf cart taxis called ‘Hoi An Go’ around town.  For $20/person, you can book a 3 hour city/area tour.  They are a cheap taxi for getting around town too if you are tired of walking.  The city tour will include a stop at the round coconut boat rides which you must do and will drive through the rice fields with the water buffaloes.  We chose a shorter 45 minute ride on one round coconut boat for about $6-7USD/person, but think you can get cheaper price with negotiating when you show them cheaper pricing online, ha!
Be sure to visit the day markets and night markets there.  Lots of cheap local food and drinks in Hoi An all along the river next to old town Hoi An and on nearby parallel streets.  Lots of foot and body massage places too, very cheap. Bel Marina also offers spa services at reasonable prices.  Their restaurant on site has reasonable food prices too for lunch/dinner too.  
The hotel also has a scheduled free shuttle to the nearby beach, but their pool is huge.  They own the property next door too which has a roof top infinity pool with great views.  Just do it!!
We had no problem using our Apple chargers in their outlets in VN or Thailand, but if concerned, you can buy a travel converter for not too much.  Tipping is not customary or expected in VN or Thailand but is much appreciated if you do and if you return to a place, they give special service. Only tip $1 or 2.  
If you have the time and your dates are flexible, you could book a reasonable transpacific repositioning cruise to Asia (about 14-21 days) from Seattle/Vancouver, CA or vice versa in late Fall or Spring to get you over to Asia.  From there, you can catch a reasonable flight to where you want to go in Asia.  Flights will be your biggest cost unless you don’t mind economy.  Use Google flights to put a saved watch to where you want to go.  I’ve seen economy flights in economy for under $600 pop-up for one-way from Houston to Vietnam.  Use vacationstogo.com to find cheap cruises if that interests you.

Seriously, in some areas it’s nice and quiet and then for example if you go to Patong or Phuket mainstreet it’s horrible. 
I as a woman was harassed by women (?) in the Main Street of Phuket and in a party street in Bangkok. They can get quite aggressive for different reasons. Some even try to lure your man while you are standing next to them, others try to make money of you by pleasing you too 😆.

That’s the disclaimer. Apart from the high-prostitution areas it’s a very nice country to travel to. Enjoy!

Krabi is a good place. You can also do island hopping. Food are the best and not as crowded as other touristy place in Thailand.

Phuket is super touristy but if you book outside of Patong, closer to the old city, there are some lovely beaches. The best street food in Thailand is in Bangkok and Chiang Mai (best food in general is up north) but the islands have no shortage of good restaurants. I’d recommend Krabi or Koh Lanta if you want to mostly have beach time with stunning views. If you want a mix of beach and excursions and activities, Phuket can be a good HQ, as there are day trips to all of the most popular things in the area that leave from there.

I went to my honeymoon at Thailand. Love love love the country.
We spent few days at Phuket. Stayed on the Patong Beach area. Super lively area for drinks, walks & also have Jungceylon mall for shopping. Also did a day trip to Phi Phi islands. It was awesome.
Then we went to Krabi for 3-4 nights. We stayed on the Aonang Beach. Definitely not as lively as Phuket/Patong but it definitely is romantic and much serene. They also had great street food options. We did Railay bay and some other island hopping on one of those days.
Lastly, we stayed few days in Bangkok near Siam Square. Super lively city with loads of food options & shopping paradise. Since street food is a must - please try Raan Jay Fai’s Crab Omlette (it’s a Michelin starred street food & a must try)

Another vote for Koh Samui
My wife and I had our Honeymoon there a while ago. It’s more laid back than Phuket… 

Beautiful beaches, nice resorts and less crowded than Phuket. 

It’s not difficult to get to either, just another quick flight from Bangkok.

We loved it so much that we went back a few years later for several more days. 

If you have some extra time, I’d go visit Chiang Mai as well for a slightly different mountain / nature vibe.

None of Europe is tropical, and with the possible exception of the Canary Islands in a good year, I would consider none of it for a tropical beach vacation in December/January. 

I would also avoid Egypt, with everything going on in the neighboring countries at the moment.

Most of Asia is cheap and offers the tropical beaches you’re looking for. I would look into the “koh”’s in Thailand, Vietnam, and The Philippines. When opting for the Philippines, do check your government’s travel advice before booking, as not all of the Philippines is safe for travel.

Only warm places in Europe: Canary islands 
Cheap and warm places in Asia, that are close by to Berlin: Northern Cyprus
If you have a little more budget for a vacation in South-East-Asia: Bali isn't it. It may be warm there, but it's raining season + the beaches are NOT good. Visit some other places in Indonesia (there are plenty) or sabah in Malaysia/Borneo or Palawan in Philippines or Phuket in Thailand. Please check travel warnings from your countries foreign affairs office first before travelling & stay safe!

>I understand flights to Europe/Mediterranean are never cheap from US    

Your flight should typically be your cheapest cost. If you pay a bit more to travel, but you have a very cheap destination, it's a huge W.     

Some options off the top of my head where I've been that offer affordable accommodation and entertainment include Slovenia, Croatia, Vietnam, Turkiye (especially right now with the country in economic crisis) or a Balkans trip (Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania)

    Reply:1
    We definitely don't have affordable accommodations on the Croatian coast. Also, it's very cold and windy in December. It's not even nice to sit on the beach in your clothes, let alone swim

        I guess it depends on definition of "affordable" but yeah, point taken about the timing - I forgot OP was coming in December! Maybe not the med then :)

Do you have to fly in and out of Thailand from BKK? It would be a more efficient use of time to fly into Thailand BKK / DMK and out of Thailand HKT (Phuket). Or vice versa. Check the prices on seperate flight tickets or a multicity ticket instead of a return ticket. Even if it is a bit more, factor in the money you'd save by having one less domestic flight in Thailand.

    Reply:1
    Yess, the direct flights are costing is way more

Comment:
*Here updated ITINERARY 

5th Nov: Bangkok Arrival

Malls: Platinum Fashion Mall and December Mall are great for shopping. You could also consider Siam Paragon or Central world for a wider variety of stores.

Suggestion: If you have energy left, the Asiatique Riverfront is a unique night market on the river with great dining options.


6th Nov: Phuket Arrival & Night Markets

Markets: Try Chillva Market or Naka Market (Phuket Weekend Market) for local foods, clothes, and souvenirs.


7th Nov: Phuket Beaches & Bangla Road

Beaches: Beyond the main Patong Beach, consider Kata Beach or Karon Beach for a quieter vibe and scenic spots.

Nightlife: Bangla Road is lively, but if you’d like a more relaxed evening option, Kata Noi has some nice beachfront bars.


8th Nov: Phi Phi Island and Nearby Beaches

Boat Tour: A full-day boat tour around Phi Phi might include snorkeling stops. Consider booking a sunrise tour to avoid crowds at iconic spots like Maya Bay.


9th Nov: Old Phuket Town and Weekend Market

Old Phuket Town: Be sure to check out the vibrant Sino-Portuguese architecture and try some local cafés for a brunch experience.

Market: The Sunday Walking Street Market is very popular, with a variety of food and crafts.


10th Nov: Krabi Arrival

Markets: The Ao Nang Night Market offers a great range of local food options. Consider exploring Krabi Town Walking Street as well.


11th Nov: Railay Beach Day

Railay: The beach here is stunning. Besides relaxing, you can hike up to Railay Viewpoint if you’re up for it or explore Phra Nang Cave Beach nearby.


12th Nov: 7-Island Hopping Tour

Tour Options: Sunset tours are indeed less crowded. Most will include Poda Island, Chicken Island, and Phra Nang Cave Beach. Be sure to bring snorkeling gear or check with the tour operator for rentals.


13th Nov: Return to Bangkok + Shopping

Tofu Mall & Pratunam Market: Great choices for shopping, and you could also add MBK Center or Terminal 21 for more unique finds.


14th Nov: Shopping Day in Bangkok

Additional Option: You might want to consider Chatuchak Market if you're interested in a large selection of unique items, but it’s only open on weekends.



---

Additional Suggestions

Island Hopping (Alternative): If you want another unique island experience, Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai are beautiful and less crowded options near Phuket and Krabi.

Bangkok River Cruise: For a unique last night in Bangkok, you might enjoy a short river cruise with dinner along the Chao Phraya River.

    Reply:1
    Loved your suggestions. We're for sure going to consider the Bangkok river cruise for our last day and visit terminal 21 if we've time. Do you think I'll be able to shop (big shopaholic) properly if i follow the above itenary?

Where are you flying from? Japan and Korea aren't that close to Thailand and Vietnam so you'll lose a day traveling getting between those countries. I would consider doing Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia or Myanmar. You can start and just do a circle clockwise or counter clockwise. I'd suggest (not knowing where you are coming from however) starting in Hanoi in northern Vietnam. A month goes by fast but some must see places in my opinion to research and consider depending on what you like: (I would chose a few from each)

Vietnam: Hanoi, Halong Bay, Sapa, Hoi An, Hue, Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City. 

Cambodia: Siem Reap (Angkor Wat is a must see), Phnom Penh, Battanbang, Lake Tonle Sap.

Thailand: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Ayutthaya, Ko Toh, Chiang Rai

Laos: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Nong Kiau, Luang Namtha, Wat Phu, Phonsavan

Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kuching, Pulau Perhentian, Melaka

Myanmar: Maymyo, Kyaiktiyo, Bagon, Ngapali, Inle Lake, Mandalay and Yangon

Everywhere is safe, and everywhere can be dangerous if your stumbling around drunk by yourself at 3am. 

Flights between places can be super cheap and some are only reached by bus/train. There are some amazing ways to get between places by boat on the Mekong where the 8 hours of travel are quite the experience on a long boat. 

My first trip to SE Asia I went for a month and only went to 3 countries and made 8 stops and I felt rushed but I like to try to spend a minimum of a few days in each place. Went back for 9 months and only went to 6 countries and was spending usually a week minimum in each stop. 

You know how you like to travel so figure out what works but rushing it over there can be very frustrating because things don't always work on time and the weather can be tricky. 

I've never been to Japan or Korea. 

I did go to the Philippines and Manila, and El Nido were incredible but I only went to those two places to meet up with a friend who was on tour there and it was a spur of the moment thing. 

Hope this helps a little. I'm jealous. Enjoy.

The worst parts of the Philippines are the cities. By far. They’re awful. The best thing about the Philippines are the islands and the small towns.

    I was going to say this. Maybe skip the Philippines until they have more time to really get out there and do it justice. Go to Hong Kong for a couple of days instead, add the extra days to Japan or Thailand. Skip Singapore.

Comment:
I would narrow it down to maybe 2-3 countries that are closer together. I did a 2 week trip to Thailand and Cambodia (ended up being more like 12 days on the ground after travel days). I wish I had had more time to just fully explore those two without hopping around every few days.

Given that, I think you can skip Bangkok and go straight to Chiang Mai or go down to Phuket and explore the islands from there. I know Cambodia wasn't listed but Angkor Wat was incredible and would highly highly recommend including in your itinerary.

-----------------------------
Comment:
If Philippines: You don’t need to stay in Manila because traffic is bad and there’s not much to see (except Intramuros, I guess?) unless you want to go shopping and drinking.

You can go to the beach like Boracay or Palawan instead and If you have more time, the Mt. Province area is really nice but the travel time is crazy (12 hours one way) and can only be done by bus from the city.

Comment:
There is really no reason to pick 4. Aaia is easy, safe and affordable to get around in. And why would you want to spend a week in Singapore? You know it's especially a city filled with Super Wealthy Chinese correct? Not much to do and very little true culture that will be shared with you; skip it. Try Cambodia, Taiwan or Malaysia instead.

Comment:
If I was living in Korea, I’d do Japan as a long weekend. Osaka is a short flight from Seoul (assuming you live there). 

If you’re going to SEA I think it would depend on budget and interest. Most of SEA is pretty safe if you’re a reasonably alert traveller. 

Singapore - would be the most expensive, but arguably the safest. City vibes mainly.

Thailand - huge diversity between the islands, Bangkok, and the hills of the north (Chiang Mai). It’s worth seeing all three.

Vietnam - covers a huge amount of territory vertically. South (Ho Chi Minh), central (Hoi An), north (Ha Noi), and super north (Sapa) all offer very different experiences and also worth experiencing all.

I’m least experienced with the Philippines so I won’t comment on that, but much of Indonesia is wonderful to explore too.

I would also throw in a suggestion for Cambodia if you’re willing (Myanmar is also excellent but more unpredictable these days.)

Fairly easy to visit Vietnam/Thailand in the same trip and cover a decent amount while stretching a budget.

Even for a first trip to Japan, you need like 2 weeks for the cities you played plus day trips, week and a half minimum for those 3 cities only.

Singapore isn't even a one day city, let alone one week. It's a layover city where you can pop out of the airport and have dinner somewhere and get a feel for Singaporean life. 

I don't know what you're doing for a week in those Filipino cities. Get out and be close to the water.

    Reply:1
    Well I guess since we’re living in Korea even though we haven’t gone before we could go back to Japan on a long weekend after the first trip 🤔 

For a first trip where would we absolutely have to visit in Japan if you had to choose?

Right thinking to move Singapore to 2 days if we keep it on the list

        Japan is beautiful you could do the major places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa and be lost there forever. Also anywhere up north or going to Mount Fuji.

Singapore sucks. So much more to see in the other four with a week each.

That said, your plans are a lil too ambitious and most of your time will be spent traveling and not enjoying the location if your time is very tight and you have a strict 4 week limit. Consider cutting down the cities per country like Thailand could be Bangkok and Phuket and skip Chang Mai. Phillipines go to Palawan or a similar island instead of Manila. Maybe stop in Manila for a couple days only and then go to enjoy the beach

First of all, all those countries for just 1 month will be a rush and you wouldn't see much. You'll just be wasting a lot of time travelling on planes/buses/ferries...

Unless you only want to visit cities (which to me aren't that interesting for more than 2-3 days) I feel you'll be missing too much. You'd be better off picking 1 or two of those. 

You can easily spend a month in all those countries (other than Singapore - 2-3 days max is enough).

I'd decide what you want to do most. Beaches, history, sight seeing, nightlife... And then decide on just a couple of those. Otherwise if you try to fit too much in you'll maybe only get to visit 1-2 places per country. 

Personally I'd choose Japan or the Philippines. Never been to Japan but want to go, an dive spent 2 months island hopping the Philippines. 

You can do a lot of stuff yourself. I terms of getting around 12go.asia is good for booking buses/trains/ferries... 

If you are after just day tours - Klook, Get Your Guide and Viator are good for finding and booking stuff. But there will alos be others locally that could be cheaper that aren't on those apps.

This is really ambitious for 4 weeks. For reference, I spent 6 weeks with the following itinerary:

Myanmar (Yangon, Bagan, Inle Lake- honestly NOT recommended b/c of ongoing genocide & general brutal suppression by military dictatorship)
Cambodia (Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat)
Malaysia (KL, Kinabatangan Borneo)
Vietnam (Hanoi, Halong Bay cruise, HCM)

We spent >1 week in Angkor & were just able to get through the major ruins plus a day trip hiking to a natural spring.

If you’re outdoorsy/adventurous, you could spend a decent amount of time in Borneo. Safari, mountaineering, diving, cave or jungle trekking…

Agree with folks here re:Philippines to skip Manila & choose a beach destination instead. We enjoyed Cebu & Bohol!

3 countries max.  You have to factor in down time, or wasting a whole day traveling.  Personally, I would do Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, or Vietnam.   Relax and enjoy your time.  If not, you're going to waste so much time getting from point A to B, and having to get to and check in and out of hotels all of the time.   I know it's tempting to try to do that much in a month, but trust me, it will go by fast.   Vietnam has been my new place, but I love Cambodia and Laos.   I spent a year in Thailand in the 80's, and it's just not the same anymore.

Sounds like an epic graduation celebration! To avoid burnout, I’d suggest sticking to 3-4 major stops. Start with Thailand (Bangkok and Phuket for the food and beaches), then head to Vietnam (maybe Hanoi for culture or Ho Chi Minh for energy). After that, visit your friend in Singapore, and if you’re up for it, stop in Taiwan (Taipei is super fun) before heading to Japan.

If you’re considering China, Hong Kong or Macau could be quick but fascinating stops. Check out this guide that helped me when I was traveling in China [https://gowithguide.com/China](https://gowithguide.com/China) Congrats on med school, and enjoy the adventure! 🎉

Fly to Krabi from Bangkok

Bus to Ko Lanta from the airport 

Stay at Khlong Nin Beach

This is a mature chill beautiful beach where middle age European families stay. 

Use Google maps to find a good hotel. 

I recommend the Emerald Beach snorkel tour, try to find a boat with less then 10-15 people on it.

I took my son to Thailand when he was 10, but had the luxury of not having to plan the itinerary (my brother's wife is from Thailand, she has a lot of family there, we do a "road trip" type of vacation with them every time we go, in addition to some time just relaxing at their house, and I just have to show up and pay my share of whatever it all costs).  It's also going to depend a lot on what your kid likes in general.

We spent a few nights in floating cabins (there's a room with a bed, plus a porch, as an individual unit, and a bunch are lashed together around a cove in a lake, so you can swim right from your front porch.  And then there's also a floating restaurant, then the usual squatty-potty up on a hillside nearby.  There were boat tours you could take to see cool rock formations and wildlife, probably hiking on shore (it's a national park) though we didn't do that, and of course all the swimming you can stand.  The national park is Khao Sok, and I'm guessing there's more than one operator of cabins like that, but I'm not sure the exact one or place we went to, since other people made the arrangements.

My son also enjoyed markets and just walking around and seeing all the different food from usual, as well as the touristy stuff.  He bought a laser pointer that my brother (former airline pilot) said is probably illegal for a consumer to own in the US, and definitely to never point it at airplanes.  

We did go to a couple beaches, like in Hua Hin, very briefly in Phuket, and then in Singapore when we had a 23-hour layover there.  If your kid is into specific beach activities (snorkeling, kayaking, whatever), you might want to research the best places to be able to do those activities.

Temples are cool, as are ancient ruins--too many options to name specific ones, but you can google or ask for more specific recommendations.

Or if you end up going north instead of to beaches, Chiang Mai is cool, but the white temple in Chiang Rai (a little farther north) is really awesome, even for a teenager sick of looking at temples.  It's cool from every angle, but when you get inside the main building (it's one-way walking), turn around and look at the wall behind you.  The artwork on the walls includes lots of modern references, with the artist's opinion on how close they are to Buddhists' version of  "heaven" or "hell" indicated by how high or low they are on the wall.  

I forget where exactly in Thailand these are, but they were on our trip to the north, but there's a crack that opened up after an earthquake not all that long ago, and the people who own the land have created trails for you to explore it a bit, so that's kinda cool.  I seem to recall they had rolling "sleds" you could ride, too.  And there are various waterfalls you can swim in, hot springs you can cook an egg in, and we went to some canyon thing that was pretty cool, too.  If you want specifics, I can probably search my (and my sibs') Facebook posts for a little more info.

It wasn't on the trip with my kiddo, but we went to Pu Chi Fa in the far north, and there was frost on the ground one morning, which amazed all the tourists from around there, and we did a sunrise hike to the Laos border (picked up in a songthaew at like 4 a.m., driven to the trailhead, hiked in the dark becoming lighter, arrived at the summit before sunrise, and watched the sun come up over the forested hills of Laos.  

You can do an official border crossing into Laos and/or Myanmar near the Golden Triangle area, or there was one we walked across a bridge into a touristy market in Myanmar (but they keep your passports at the border control office so you can't just wander into the rest of the country at will).

There are elephant sanctuaries all around Thailand, but do your research on which ones actually benefit the elephants and put them first, not tourists.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head right now, but yeah, if you want specifics on any of the places I mentioned going to, I can try to find out more.

    thanks!  what month were you at Khao Sok?

        I don't remember specifically, but we've always gone in December-January, so around then.  Perfectly pleasantly warm, not as crazy hot as the other seasons.  (Coming off the rainy season though, so one trip we took it was still pretty humid and there was flooding still going down.)

Kanchanaburi is pretty nice and chill. Getting a bike and just driving to all the temples or going out and just getting lost. You'll find yourself in some scenic places. 

If you want beach but not party central, check out Koh Chang.

Do you snorkel or dive? We snorkeled in the Surin islands (stayed in Khao Lak which is much closer to the departure than Phuket) and it was wonderful.

    Reply:1
    i do dive / snorkel - but not very often.

I live on an island so im familiar with the "sport"

        Reply:2
        Got it, no need to shift if that's not something you were looking for. Adventure, thrill, etc isn't super clear for what you want to do.

            Reply:3
            snorkeling does fit into the category - don't take me wrong - but i would probably not change my itinerary just for that.

maybe quads, ziplines, safari, kayak, rafting might be more towards what im looking for

If you're into "adventure, landscape, nature, thrill" then you can cut both Bangkok and Singapore down to a minimum or totally. Do a 5-day PADI dive course at Krabi. Personally I wouldn't bother with Singapore. There is none of those 4 things you want there IMO. Go visit the Golden Triangle or something in Thailand or do some treking.

    Reply:1
    Phuket too. Have a look on Travelfish. There are a dozen islands (many accessible from Krabi) more fitting for what you’re after in Thailand.

You can easily visit Tiger Cave and the hot springs as a half-day trip from Krabi—there’s no need to spend the night there. I’d also suggest cutting down your time in Phuket unless partying is your priority; it’s a bit too touristy for my taste.

For accommodations in Krabi, consider Ao Nang or Noppharat Thara. Both are fantastic options and far better than staying in Krabi Town. From these spots, you can easily visit Railay and Tonsai Beach by canoe or a small boat. In general, Ao Nang makes an excellent base for exploring the nearby islands and attractions.

    by full day i meant a day trip - which probably takes 6-8 hours - im not staying for the night!

Stay directly in Koh Tao and Koh Phangan if possible to explore those islands. You can take ferries / jet boats but they have a vibe of their own, and it's nice to avoid the ferry day trip stuff. If you want dives, Koh Tao is some of the best. You could easily spend 3-4 days there alone just diving, relaxing, eating fish, etc. 

Phi Phi is great and I'd recommend it even if you can't find the best accomodations, but you may want to consider Railay or Ao Nang as alternatives.

I am just about to leave Thailand after 3.5 weeks here and I'd suggest you cut down on your destinations a lot.

Transiting between places took a lot longer than we had anticipated *every time* so we lost more time than expected transiting so would definitely change that were we to do the trip again. 

I'd suggest not staying anywhere for less than 3 nights, if not 4. We did mostly 3 night stops and a couple of 2s and the 2s felt pretty much pointless and the 3s felt rushed

If you're doing full moon you need at least 3 nights to hit the main events.

        Reply:2
        If you have no other choice, but a lot of people prefer Jungle Experience or OXA Beach to the main party, and it's pretty rough to do a 24 hour party and leave right after... Definitely recommended to spend a few days, but if you absolutely can't...

Siam Reap, you are doing some of Thailand already and Angkor Wat is incredible. Definitely Krabi over Phuket as well.

Comment:
Siem Reap. Angkor Wat is great, Bayon temple is great, Ta Prohm is amazing.

Krabi is great too, by the way. If you're not there to party, I'd go for Krabi and Phang Nga over Phuket. In Bangkok, see if you can find a reputable street food tour. So good.

Full disclosure: Chiang Mai was over 20 years ago so my memories are a bit foggy. Siem Reap five years ago or so, Krabi and Phang Nga 8 or 9 years ago. Haven't been to Phuket.

If you're interested in seeing Angkor Wat then it's definitely worth the trip to Siem Reap. Consider going to Phnom Penh to see the prison museum and/or killing fields while you're in Cambodia - it's very heavy but important.

    Reply:1
    The prison museum is so good (and so depressing)

Comment:
Siem Reap temple complex is almost like an outdoor museum, and the huge trees with roots in the temple complex add to the incredible atmosphere.  It’s a once in a lifetime experience without equal and we’ve seen quite a few wonders of the world.  In Chiang Mai there are things to see and do and it’s interesting enough but doesn’t come close to Siem Reap.  If I could only choose 1, it would be Siem Reap 1000 times over.  When we went, the guide wanted to meet us at 4:30 am at our hotel.  I said no way, I’m on vaca, what on earth for ? He said “to see the sun rise over Ankhor Watt”.  We compromised and met slightly later, it was still dark.  It was totally worth it !

Angkor for sure. Have a great trip.

That's a no brainer. Siem Reap is worth a visit in itself and Angkor Wat is one of the world's greatest historical sites.  Chaing Mai can't compare

For just 2 weeks, I would stay in Thailand and not add another country. Angkor Wat is incredible and worth the visit. If you add it to your 2 week trip, then I would prioritize Chiang Mai over Bangkok, visit Krabi (Railay Beach specifically) and consider adding another island like Koh Lipe or Koh Lanta with a brief stay on Koh Phi Phi for an all day boat tour including Maya Bay.

Siem Reap and hire a car to take you to see Bang Melea. It is absolutely worth the approx 90 min drive.

I'd visit Angkor Wat, there is nowhere like it in the world.

Chiang Mai is nice. It has a sleepy, sorta hippie vibe that is completely different from Bangkok. But nothing compares to the temples near Siem Reap in Cambodia. If you go, hire a tuk tuk driver to take you around for two days and make sure to hit up smaller temples like Tha Prom, not just Angkor Wat.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Siem reap. Angkor is beyond stunning and indescribable. Also, the downtown of Siem reap has some really good food. 

At our hotel we were able to pay for a tour with a private tour guide, air conditioned car, and a packed lunch from the hotel and it was pretty cheap.

-----------------------------
Comment:
>Which would you suggest?

Siem Reap. While there try and see the Phare Circus, the skill shown by the performers is excellent and they tell a story at the same time... well worth the fee. I love Chiang Mai, the temples are cool, November is the perfect time of year but Angkor Wat is a better experience overall. I also agree with another commenter, go to the Killing Fields and S21 in Phnom Penh... it's eye opening.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Another vote for Siem Reap. Chiang Mai is fine, but Angkor is spectacular.

-----------------------------

Chiang Mai is a nicer city, but if you want to see Angkor Wat or the Killing Fields, then going to Siem Reap/PP is worth the visit.

Went to Thailand just a year ago, with the same set of cities, id say you can book personal tours (just you and a driver for basically all morning) for really super cheap. My wife and I has a driver take us all over Bangkok and Changi Mai to multiple Temples and places (driving sometimes over an hour between places)  with lunch and water for like just over $200 U.S. (well not including tip) for the day. Its the only country we've ever booked our own personal tours, as anywhere else its prohibitively expensive.

Do you have travel days planned between each stop? Because if not that’s way too many spots and realistically one day less for each location.

Also the month is important, depending on the season it could be super rainy, hot or Smokey in some places also.

    First for the season, would be within my uni break therefore within the time of November 2025-February 2026. As it's really far away, would need to add those in the official plan , just wrapped up in the excitement of going at the moment and trying to work out where to go etc.

        Sabah is famous for its beach, nature and wildlife. Even if you only make Kota Kinabalu (capital city of Sabah) your base, pristine islands are just 30 mins boat ride away and mountain view destinations are just 2-3 hour car ride away. 

Malacca/Penang is more history and culture. Cameron Highlands while having beautiful scenery, does not beat the highland sceneries in Sabah in my opinion. I wouldn't skip Sabah if I were you.

Have you visited Chiang Mai? It’s not a beach location, but it’s easy (and inexpensive) to reach by plane from other regions in Thailand and it has a lot to offer: elephants, amazing food (khao soi), and a sticky waterfall (Bua Thong). We took our children a few years ago when they were around the same age as your children and we had a great time.

    Yes I have a couple of times over the past 20 years! We hadn't planned for an inland trip this time, mainly wanted to focus on the sea, watersports, island boat trips etc! I'll keep it in mind though, it might be a cooler location too. Thanks 🙂

That's fine but I'd probably fly to Krabi and go straight to Koh Lanta, then stay in Krabi (Railay or Tonsai beach usually, or maybe Ao Nang if you prefer shopping over activities), then Phi Phi, then Phuket.

That's the direction the ferry usually takes. If you go out to Phi Phi and then back to Koh Lanta you're backtracking unnecessarily.

Koh Samui is not really an option, it's miles away on the other side of the coast.

Just do Bangkok and one of the islands in the south. It's pointless to see more than one in a single trip. All are fine options to relax for a week, and I can't image why you'd want to spend all that time traveling between them. 

Bangkok few days excitement and food, southern island for one week relaxation on the sea.

You're traveling during the high season for tourism in Thailand. Highly advise to book accommodation at least 2 weeks in advance.

It's highly unlikely many will read your post, especially in that format.

**Bottom line:** 7 countries in 97 days is of course totally doable. It's also great that you've done massive research and have so much planned. Many people come onto this forum and expect everyone to be their private Travel Agent. It's fabulous that you've put so much effort into your trip.

That said, a few thoughts...

Be ready to throw much of your itinerary in the trash for 3 main reasons:

**i.** You're going to love some places and want to stay longer.

**ii.** You're going to not like the vibe in some places and want to leave sooner.

**ii.** You're going to learn about places that you never heard of from locals and other travellers, and some of those places are going to sound fantastic and you'll want to check them out.

**Bottom, bottom line:** The HUGE advantage of a long 97 day trip is freedom. You are blessed with the flexibility to go with the flow and make the trip fantastic. You aren't nailed to a specific itinerary, you have the ability to adapt. *Be open to getting off the beaten path.*

At least please consider this approach.

Good luck with your research and happy travels. You're going to see some great stuff.

    Reply:1
    Yeah, Reddit kind of killed my formatting. I'm definitely looking forward to the freedom to change my schedule at will. Typically I like to have my trips a bit over planned so that I can make educated changes on the fly once things come up. 

The biggest sticking points for this trip will be that I'll have to have my Vietnam cave tour scheduled significantly in advance, and I'll have a friend joining for a week in Cambodia. I'll still have a lot of flexibility, but some of my dates will be more set in stone

Comment:
i think it’s horrible to plan a 3 months trip that detailed. with that time on hand its way better to go with the flow and enjoy a few places longer. you might meet people along the journey and want to spend more time or travel somewhere with them. in SEA everything can be organized from one day to the other. no reason in planning everything out in detail before even starting the journey. And with that many places and your rush through the countries and its landmarks you will at some point burn out. its gets really tiring to move every few days to a new place. to literaly wake up every morning to do the next activity, etc…

-----------------------------
Comment:
If you're going to do Malaysia, go somewhere more interesting than KL - Penang, for example. Much more to do and see there in three days and easily flyable from Singapore with Air Asia. Otherwise, I'd just skip it altogether and have another day in SG and a couple more in Lombok.

You have 3 months... Just go with the flow lol

-----------------------------
Comment:
The schedule is kind of hard to follow for me but I do see a few things I could input here:

for hiking / trekking in Indonesia, maybe look into Java. There are many lesser visited peaks that could be perfect to help you get ready for Nepal. There are also some other peaks nearby to Rinjani like Pergasingan Hill. Shorter but good ones to get into hiking straight up. 

In Bali, Batur was quite easy, I believe there are two routes, one harder one so maybe look into that if you plan to climb it. 

Vientiane - you really only need 1 day here, there is not too much to do. This could be another day allocated to Indonesia! (https://www.girlgonecoconuts.com/asia-travel/one-day-in-vientiane)

Singapore - have you been? It is quite expensive, and you might find 4 days is too much. Ive actually been here a couple of time for visa runs and every time I go I question why I went. Again, could be more days elsewhere if you end up agreeing. 

I do believe this is all entirely doable but as the person below me said, keep this itinerary but be ready to go with the flow. Some places will really surprise you (vang vieng i.e. for me and Ninh Binh Vietnam), others you will wonder "why am I here" (i.e. Singapore for me). SO my point? Keep the itinerary as a loose idea of the direction you are going but dont book too far ahead so you can gauge how youre feeling PLUS you'll need some downtime to rest and recover from always being on the go! 

I hope this helps :)

I’d recommend giving yourself rest days travelling to a new location every 3-4 days is a more draining than you’d realise, especially with the stress of travelling in unfamiliar countries.

Give yourself at least 1-2 days to do nothing, take stock, do laundry every 2 weeks or so. I’d do that in lower COL places to save money too

I've been to Vietnam for 3 weeks, Philippines for 3 weeks and Cambodia for 3 days. 



My 2 cents. 4 nights in hoi an is way too much. There isn't really anything to do there as far as I'm aware. We walked around all day and saw the lanterns/boats when it got dark. Even a full day felt like too much time there.  



Vietnam in general I wasn't a super big fan of. But that may be a personal thing. Very crowded in Hanoi, and again, not much to do and we didn't enjoy the food much. I liked da nang a lot better. The caves and bana hills were pretty cool



In the Philippines I went to manila, Cebu, boracay and Coron.  Coron has some super cool scenery and tours we went on. Cebu has some cool tours, we swam with whale sharks and saw a bear church.  but you have to travel a long way to get to them. Borocay is an amazing beach with some expensive water sport activities. And they have a bit more western type of food there from my experience. Philippines is great for ocean/beach/nature experiences. 




Cambodia was super cool for the little time I was there. People were super super friendly and Angkor wat/ the surrounding temples were crazy cool.  




Maybe not helpful. Just my experience in SE Asia. Your schedule sounds very very busy and tiring.

-----------------------------
Comment:
For me that’s too much traveling yeah. I’d cut out the Khao Sok, Ao Nang part and then it becomes much more reasonable. I prefer 3 nights in any given place. 2 at a minimum.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Yeah, this seems way too packed. You're overdoing it.

I haven't done Cambodia yet, but I'm told you can spend many days at Angkor Wat. Two nights does seem very crowded, especially in-and-out of the whole country that fast. On that point alone your itinerary is immediately too crowded.

Three nights in Phuket with a day trip to Koh Phi Phi is going to be super frustrating, you barely have any time to soak any of it in. The south should be a time to relax. You've done the same thing on the gulf side, a "day trip to Koh Phangan" from Koh Samui is insanity, you won't get any of the night life or time to enjoy the island.

**As a general rule, don't stay a just single night in a place you actually want to visit. You won't have enough time to actually experience it, and will be too focused on checking in and checking out to enjoy yourself.**

Personally speaking, I'd:

* Take just a little more time in Bangkok. It's a cool city. Lots to see.
* Nix Cambodia entirely. Sorry. Thailand is a big country, doing a two-day fly-in-fly-out sideshow to Cambodia is lunacy to me. (If you must do Cambodia, think hard about significantly reshaping your Thailand part of the trip.)
* Spend more time in Chiang Mai. Give yourself breathing room. There's a lot to see there, great food, awesome culture. Don't rush it. I'd have gone to Pai, but you have a packed itinerary already.
* Dump Koh Samui, just stay on the Andaman (Phuket) side, where it seems you have more interest. Consider an overnight on Koh Phi Phi rather than doing a day trip. Take more time in Ao Nang. Fly back from Krabi, rather than Koh Samui.

That should give you a little more breathing room.

Sample itinerary, based on what you already have — looks like 17 nights, I'd do something more like:

Adjust above as needed / based on your own vibes. You can see:

* I've pushed out Khao Sok and Chai Lai to two nights each. 
* Koh Phi Phi is now an optional trip from Ao Nang. It's closer, and you can choose to stay in Ao Nang instead or do Railay based on vibes. 
* Bangkok is moved to the end of the trip — you don't want to miss your flight back to Toronto, so if anything goes wrong while you're island hopping, you'll be glad you have the buffer room.

    First off thanks for the time you put into this response, appreciate your advice.

I agree and I'm going to drop Cambodia, but Khao Sok and Chai Lai I will keep as one night I think it's enough for those small excursions.  I may take the extra 2 nights from Cambodia and use them forr Pai.  I also want to keep Samui as I've heard great things online and from friends, and we have a nice resort "Vana Belle" picked out to finish the trip at a luxury resort.  Not sure if I'll be able to fit in Phangan or Koh Tao if you're saying a day trip is not worth it.  A friend of mine said bottle beach viewpoint was a highlight.

Do you recommend I drop Phuket completely and just Fly from Chiang Mai into Krabi?  And use Ao Nang as a base for a couple daytrips to Railay, and Koh Phi Phi, or maybe James Bond island?

For culture and nightlife, I prefer Koh Tao and Koh Phangan to Koh Samui, for what's it's worth. But if you're just staying at a luxury resort, then Koh Samui is fine. They're very similar islands. You can do Koh Phangan or Koh Tao within a day by speedboat,  just factor in that you're spending a about hour on boat/pier each way. 

>Do you recommend I drop Phuket completely and just Fly from Chiang Mai into Krabi? 

Personally, I like the spectacle that is Phuket, especially Bangla Road. It's something a little different, just a total change of pace. But it's not for everyone, and going straight to Krabi makes some sense if you want to keep things chill. 

>And use Ao Nang as a base for a couple daytrips to Railay, and Koh Phi Phi, or maybe James Bond island?

Yeah this seems reasonable. A lot of people around Ao Nang and Railay are just taking longtail boats to different beaches and doing island hopping during the day, there are a tonne of choices.

        I'm sad you're going to drop Siem Reap/Cambodia.  Angkor Wat and the other buildings in the park are amazing and better to see it sooner than later.  I spent 5 days twice in the park and surrounds and still didn't see all of it but 3 days would be a great use of your time.   You would also experience another country besides Thailand.

            Reply:3
            I really want to see it, but am wary of too much travel days.  If I did something similar to below I could fit it in as I originally intended while reducing the amount of flights for some ferries instead.

But so many people are saying it’s crazy to travel to siem reap just for 2 nights, and I would have to take a connecting flight through Bangkok to chisng mai on the way back.

                Well Siem Reap airport is very close to the Angkor Wat park and it's very well organized.  3 nights is fine.   But then for me  I am not that crazy about beaches as I only snorkel don't really swim.   Or here is a possibility, if you rreally are not going to do Angkor Wat, you can go to Ayuthaya on a 1 night or day trip from Bangkok.  Nowhere near as good as Angkor Wats fantastic temples but will give you a small glimpse of ancient majesty.

I'd delete Khao Sok and add a day to Bangkok which is endlessly fascinating. I'd also encourage you to take a ferry from phuket to krabi and a bus from krabi to surat thani to get the ferry to koh samui. I haven't been to koh phangan but I thought Koh Tao was great. I usually discourage people from renting cars in SEA - on the off-chance something goes wrong you get more trouble than it's worth. Take the bus.

Hi there! I travelled Thailand twice, once in a rush and once chill.

If you are alone you will be good with:

- Add an extra night in BKK after landing, there's a lot to do and you have to recover from jet lag  
- Do not miss Angkor Wat, I did in an out of cambodja with 2 nights, if you are not a freak you will have plenty with one day 5am to 1pm with a tuktuk driver in Angkor Wat, its spectacular  
- Drop Phuket, the rest of your itinerary is much more worth it  
- I'd drop Khao Sok because of the rental car hassle. To me Krabi was nicer than Phuket and you can do Phi Phi from there as well.

Rest is fine.

    Reply:1
    How bad was the in-out of cambodia, were you coming from Thailand?  Was the airport/customs a hassle?  Is 2 nights enough or should I try to do 3 and remove Phuket which makes it less travel later in the trip and gives me plenty of rest time.  

Also debating if I should stay a night in Phi Phi or just do the day trip tour.

        Reply:2
        100% remove phuket, the airport is far and the old town and patong are not worth it. Whats good is to get lost in its beaches but the island is massive so it takes too much time compared to exploring koh samui, koh tao etc. or even Krabi.

I entered cambodja from vietnam by plane and got off by van to bangkok. Siem reap you can see the day or afternoon you arrive and the afternoon after Angkor, and that will be plenty if you are a fast travel which it is by the soubd of yoour original itinerary. Just dont miss Angkor since its the best landmark in all SE Asia, its so different from anything else.

I think I am going with this as my final itinerary, done my research and many people have gone in-out of Siem Reap in 2 nights and say it was worth seeing.  Very busy at the start of the trip but I have a couple easy days mixed in, and then a full week of island relaxation to finish.  Staying minimum 2 nights a stop except for Khao Sok.

I also cut Phuket completely based on 90% of people saying to skip it (hoping I don't regret it), and will spend the extra $ to taxi to Khao Sok and to the ferry pier rather then rent a car.

As they say in Thailand: "Never try, never know!"
You'll be busy and might have to adjust if anything happens but, whatever, if it's your last chance just go hard. I'd skip St. Phuketsberg personally and spend more time in the North, or in BKK.

I agree it feels a bit cramped but I can understand you feel like you should.  I think I wouldn’t but I get that you would.  Personally I would stick with Thailand.  You also have some space in the krabi / Samui.  You can make that one.  And I wouldn’t do Samui but Tao.  But that’s a personal preference what suits you best

Had a family member visit Chiang Mai as a solo traveller. He ended up traveling with people he met at his hostel for the next 6 weeks. It can be luck of the draw though but he's not the only person who has had success. Try r/ThailandTourism as well.

Koh Phi Phi was a super party island when I went there, you probably aren't going to feel the vibes (although it is super pretty). For hostels, I suggest getting to seek out the more chill hostels rather than party hostels. Unless you're a party animal, I always found it far easier to meet people there. 

Day tours are another good way to meet people.

But in general, the north is more relaxed and might be what you need if you're feeling a bit down at the moment with your socialising. 

Honestly, you don't need to try and visit every island, you've seen a couple, you're good to continue to something else, you're not missing out too much.

It’s been a reeeeaaallly long time since I went to Thailand but we had a pretty chilled time down at Railay Beach. Was definitely less party party party. Koh Lanta and Phi Phi were ok then, but probably much busier now, although less busy than Phuket. I think places that require just that little bit more effort to get to might be quieter - although then you run the risk of just being couples. Railay has good rock climbing so does attract people for that.

I’m not super familiar with Thailand, but where I’m at hostels often have organized group excursions. Or you could do like Viator or trip advisor group tours. I think it’d be easier to meet people and strike up conversations while doing something active rather than sitting at a bar.

Phi Phi is great! I don’t think Phuket  on a budget would be that great, and Krabi… just no. We met some great people on Samui though! Tao is mostly for divers. Give northern Thailand a shot. You might meet some fun people in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai.

I visited Chiang Mai about 10 years ago as a solo traveler. I enjoyed it. I also hit a small island called Koh Chang just to chill out.

A work buddy of mine just came back from Phuket and said he’ll never go back.  He’s been going to Thailand every year for the last 10-15 years.

Apparently it’s now overrun with Russians to the point where they oftentimes outnumber the locals.

There is also a lot new “communities” being built specifically for Russian migrants.

Apparently the only safe way to get cash is to get it at your hotel because if you take money out at an ATM you’re likely followed by Russians looking for a chance to rob you.

One of the other tourists at my buddy’s hotel went to a local tailor and when they walked into the store there was a Russian guy beating up the store owner.

The local police seem powerless to deal with the poor behaviour and outright crime.

It’s apparently pretty crazy in Phuket right now.

My general critique, or better, question is, do you want to be on the move so much for five months? I get that you want to see it all and experience it all, but I would be concerned about being exhausted by the end of month two or three, simply from all the resettling. 

Is there any place you might consider prioritizing over somewhere else that could be dropped (or put in an "if there's time" / "if other travelers say we can't miss it" category)?

    Reply:1
    It's definitely something something we've thought about and I guess the conclusion we've come to is if we do start to get burnt out from all the moving around we'll just have to slow down and as you suggested, miss some places completely. Generally we actually enjoy moving around to different places and hotels/areas and have had some busy holidays in the past, but they were less than a month. So we could definitely have to re-evaluate after the first two or three months

You definitely don’t need to move around that much for Bali. You can do a lot by staying at one place and using your driver to visit places rather than staying there which I would highly recommend.

    Reply:1
    Yep that makes sense. Are you referring mainly to the Munduk - Lovina - Kintamani part of the Bali trip? Where would you suggest staying as a base? Would you then find a driver in that area and stick with them or just use grab or gojek to get around?

        Reply:2
        I live in Bali and with your itinerary I would skip Lovina, one of the worst beaches in Bali. From Ubud east day trips to Munduk, Bedugul, Batur/Kintamani. App based drivers don't make sense for multi point trips, better to use local drivers, easy to meet and hire on the spot.

            Reply:3
            Okay that’s great, Lovina was the only stop we were unsure about so that makes things easier. Is there anything else or anywhere else you’d recommend us to visit while we’re there?

                Well this wd add more days but if you do want to see north Bali go to Pemuteran and cross over to Java and hike Ijen. Indonesia has sooo much to see and do you could easily do a month and just scratch the surface of a few islands and never even get to Borneo, Sumatra, Flores, Sulawesi etc

                    Reply:5
                    That's fine. We are still undecided on how to spend the last couple of weeks so we could look into extending our visa to give us an extra week or two in Indonesia. I'm going to look into the places you've mentioned now. Much appreciated, thank you!

        Reply:2
        Find a driver - you could try using Klook otherwise Bali Bogans (Aussie Based is a good start to find a driver). 

I have only stayed in Canggu/Seminyak (5 times).  Canggu traffic is rough. It sounds like Ubud might be the go for you but I’d check if they’re close to the other parts you want to travel! 

Also definitely don’t think you need to spend longer than 3 days in Phuket for Thailand - the islands are where it’s at!

Comment:
It seems like you are somewhat randomly picking locations and assigning them stay nights. Some places can be a day trip on the way to somewhere else and some places might be interesting enough to stay longer. Try giving yourself enough flexibility to change the routes if somewhere is not as interesting as you might have thought.

    Reply:1
    Or break your post up into countries to make it easier to respond. Example why KL twice for 2 and 3 nights, or Gili Air and T separately.. Just combine them together.

        Reply:2
        Good point about KL. The initial idea was to keep it a bit cheaper by getting a train from KL to Penang so rather than spending the whole day traveling we'd break it into smaller chunks and fly to KL enjoy it for a few days then have another couple hours of travel to George Town. Then when we finish in Langkawi Spend the the day traveling back to KL and have another day or two before heading to Bali.  Thinking about it now the better option would be to just fly from Phnom to George Town, and have 4 nights in KL and go to Bali a day earlier. Thanks for pointing that out. 

The reason we have split up Gili Air and T is to be able to chill out in Air and enjoy the beach. Then head to Gili T to enjoy the nightlife which will be easier if we're staying on the island itself I think

    Thanks for the comment this is super helpful!

  
We've definitely seen plenty of comments about skipping Phuket. We might cut out Phuket old town altogether and spend the extra 3 nights in Railay instead. We've heard nothing but good things about Railay.

  
Great to know that about Hoi An. We'll never say no to an extra night at a beach! We looked into Ha Long and it really seems to split opinions. In the end it came down to Ha Long or the Ha Giang Loop. My friend has lived in Vietnam 3 years and he done a 4 night trip around the loop about two weeks ago. He said it's the best thing he's done since arriving there so that swung us towards Ha Gang. I'll definitely look into Lan Ha though!

We could take or leave Vientiane. We're mainly just using it to break up the travel from Vang Vieng to Pakse. If you could have spent an extra day or two somewhere when you were in Laos where would it have been? Thanks for the tip about the trains!

Absolutely, we'll be more than happy to miss an excursion and just wonder around close to the hotel if the we get tired of all the moving. One day to recharge and just chill out in the room will be plenty if we need it.

        Reply:2
        The only places I wish I had more time were Siem Reap and Luang Prabang. Both are lovely cities with great vibes. There is loads to do in Siem Reap that I missed out on because we had 4 days and spent 3 at Angkor Watt (visiting the rats for example). I think I would have loved an extra night at Luang Prabang eating in the nightmarket and wandering around the town. 

I would also suggest (depending on your route and if you have time) the slow boat from Luang Prabang to Thailand (near Chaing Rai). It takes 2 days but the scenery is lovely.

Damn planning out every night on a 6 month trip is frigging exhausting. Definitely no need to stick to anything so rigid. First thing that jumped out at me was 5 nights in Phnom Penh, but only 3 in Bangkok? That’s backwards. And unless you just want to relax and do nothing, 7 nights in Ubud and 5 in Langkawi are both too long imo. Maybe I missed something but I thought Langkawi was lame as hell, one of the few destinations in SEA I’d be fine recommending to skip completely. 

For a next destination, if you like fantastic beaches, great scuba/snorkeling, waterfalls, scooters, super friendly people and 80’s rock ballads, i highly recommend the Philippines

    Reply:1
    Tell me about it! We mainly done it to figure out how much we're going to be paying for accommodation in each place before we go to make it easier to stick to a budget in each country.

So with Phnom Penh the first day will be a bit of a write off after spending most of the day traveling from Battambang. We're looking at it as being 3 full days, we love the hotel we found there. The extra night after Koh Rong is just to give us more flexibility with flights as getting from Koh Kong to Phnom Penh will take between 7 and 9 hours.

I would like to spend more time in Bangkok but I'm meeting my friend in Ho Chi Minh on the 10th so slightly limited there.

  
We love the look of Ubud so happy to relax there and spend some extra time wandering around. There are some great day trips from Langkawi so that'll use up 2 of those days most likely. The other days will just be chilling and recharging.

Yep the Philippines look amazing, it's most likely where we'll spend the rest of our time but it's definitely a lot more expensive than the other countries we're visiting when it comes to accommodation. The transport to get around some of the islands will also add up quickly I imagine but we might be able to make it work!

        Reply:2
        Gotcha, and I get that you need to throw in rest days somewhere, the problem is you often don’t know when you need them until your body tells you that you need them! And you can find out for yourself about Langkawi, I’d just say don’t book all 5 nights straight away :)

            Reply:3
            Oh yeah definitely, we have everything booked with free cancellation bar 2 or 3 hotels to keep things as flexible as possible while still roughly knowing what everything will cost! Good idea, we’ll book 3 and can extend or head back to George Town

That's waaaaay too much planning. So let's start with Phuket. No point staying near the airport then moving to the old town. Just pick a nice place to stay somewhere for three or four days and go there.

Next up - Ko Yao islands. Six nights for both is too much. There's not much there, and you can get from one to the other by chucking your scooter on a little ferry for an afternoon of exploring. Neither of them are very good for swimming because they are in the bay, and consequently quite muddy, with sea urchins, crabs and lots of rocks to boot. Good sunsets though.

Three nights on Ko Yao Yai would be enough, and add another night each to Phi Phi and Lanta.

Also, if you're going to Langkawi in Malaysia, why not just head south via Ko Lipe in southern Thailand? Flying north to Vietnam etc seems to be a lot of backtracking to end up back in the same place.

If I were you I’d combine the el nido and Coron portions into El Nido -> Coron via the 3 day expedition. That’s by far the best thing to do in the phillipines and will be more productive than a bunch of island hoping tours (which get very tedious). Also, unless you dive, Coron is extremely boring, so you wouldn’t miss much by just going in the boat expedition then flying out after.

Of course it's not mandatory to visit the Thai islands, but it is a distinct thing that people do. At the end of the day, assuming you have a limited schedule, adding something means removing something else right? Your characterisations of the Thai islands isn't wrong. During the day you might go on a boat trip where you can see some pretty things and do some snorkeling (I don't dive either), you can eat at a touristy cafe and sit on the beach. At night there are bars etc. You're right that it is touristy but it is a part of the backpackers circuit which you may or may not find appealing. 

If you want to experience some islandyness, Cambodia and Vietnam have their own scenes too you could look into, which you may find quicker to get to compared to travelling from Bangkok to somewhere like Koh Tao

    Why not dive? The diving outfits in these places are heavily geared towards handling first time divers for obvious reasons, there really are few better places to try it as a one off thing.

        Reply:2
        No particular reason, it's just not something I've felt a need to try. Snorkeling has been enough for me. 

I'm also not a strong swimmer so floating on top with a life jacket on I've always enjoyed.

I did about two months in Vietnam and Thailand, south to north in Vietnam and then north to south in Thailand. I didn't make it down to the islands. They'll be there, I'll probably go again.

If you can make it to Sukhothai Historical Park, I really recommend it. It's more impressive and yet less busy than Ayutthaya.

Comment:
I haven't been there in a while so I can't tell which specific island it is in 2024. But there is probably an island in this set

> there are other less popular islands like Koh Lanta, Koh Lipe, Koh Chang etc. They look far too quiet for my liking

That is being overrun by the backpacker crowd as the place "the tourists haven't ruined yet" by which they mean they are currently ruining it but development hasn't caught up with demand so the lodging is still cheap instead of a bunch of modern hotels. 

Koh Tao had this situation when I visited a long time ago and it was a fun time worth spending a couple days on.

That's 36 days, which is 5 weeks and a day, not 6 weeks. Anyway. Are you open to alter the destinations, or just the time spent in each one? 2 days for Singapore is fine, but I'm not sure how tired you will be arriving. 2.5 for Penang would be too much for me, but others tend to spend more time there. 2.5 days for Bangkok might be a bit tight. 3 for Chiang Mai is fine. What are you planning in South Korea? You gave no details. The other places I haven't been to.

Cut two of these, this is too much for two weeks, especially when you factor in ferry and bus time. Look up tickets using 12goasia to get an idea of how far apart these places are.

        Koh Samui is skippable, it caters to more high end resort crowds so if you don’t feel you need that I wouldn’t go.

Koh Tao is the scuba island, and if you only go for two days you’ll regret not having enough time to do a scuba course and really see why people go to the island. Also it will be a pretty rough itinerary for you to get back from Koh Tao.

If I were you I’d pick a side. Either gulf of Thailand (Koh Tao, Phanang, Samui) or the Andamin Sea (Phuket, Phi Phi, Krabi) and just stick with that.

            Reply:3
            Okay thanks a lot. Now I think about it more the main reason to head to koh samui was the waterfalls I heard about there but it’s not enough of a reason - I will take out samui & koh Tao

    Hey, thanks for the response. I’d like to see some quiet beaches, a waterfall/nice viewpoints & a little bit of party. The advice I have had so far is that I have put in too many stops in this itinerary & to skip koh samui/koh Tao, as it adds in too much travel time

Phuket itinerary: 
Yona floating beach club (must must do!!): you’ve to book beforehand from their website. Book for the day and go by 3-3:30 if you’re looking to chill + sunset, otherwise book for night if you’re looking to party and are w friends. Lil expensive
• Cafe Del Mar- very good vibe. Preferably get a table near the beach area.
•	⁠Smigo- beachside sundowner chill vibe. Good food, great drinks
•	⁠Baan Rim Pa - fine dine with excellent thai food (good veg options too)
•	⁠Illuzion Club for clubbing - best club in Phuket
•	⁠Raya - michellin star restaurant, book & go if you have time
•	⁠Blue elephant (v v good restaurant)
•	⁠Old Phuket town for shopping & cafes, v pretty area
•	⁠Best massage- Kim’s massage, Amla Massage, Let’s relax

This seems real busy. Flying from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, are you sure you'll be able to do the elephant sancuatary in the same day? I did that a couple years ago, and while I don't know all the options, seem to remember it was a couple hours outside the city and most traveled in the morning

-----------------------------
Comment:
I haven’t been to Indonesia but I can comment on the Thailand part.

I doubt you can go to an elephant sanctuary in the evening. Usually those are all day or at least half day tours that leave in the morning. They are far from the city and you generally can’t just walk up and go in.

Take the night train to Chiang Mai instead of flying.

If I were you I’d cut the beach parts of Thailand and spend more time in the cities. You’ve gots lots of time in Indonesia to go to beaches and I feel like you’re way too pressed in Thailand.

-----------------------------
Comment:
That's a lot to do in not much time. I'd honestly cut out half. Bali doesn't look big on the map, but it's a big island that takes time to get around. I'd suggest choosing Thailand or Indonesia. Personally Indonesia is one of my favourite countries and Thailand the opposite. A few days in Labuan Bajo (near Komodo Island) is really nice. Java Island is tons of fun too and cheap, but travel distance can be a problem with limited time. I did 3 weeks in Indonesia and felt it was barely enough, but there's so much I missed.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Skip Chiang Mai. There's so much more you could do in Bangkok.  You are basically flying up (and eating the travel time each direction) to visit Temples, which Bangkok has. 

There are no KBV-DPS flights, so that travel day completely eaten by a transfer or two.

Wherever you go just don't go to Pattaya. It's the worst place in Thailand.

Malaysia especially Georgetown is a good choice for something different from Thailand. Great for meeting people from different places and the locals all speak excellent English. Lots of things to do. Good food everywhere.

South Korean tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in Vietnam by a pretty big margin, so you'll probably end up meeting a lot of your compatriots there.

Tbh based on your criteria Indonesia/bali would be an option. You don’t have to stay in the tourist heavy areas though, like Canggu or Seminyak, there’s remote places around the island, also plenty of other smaller islands around that you can just jump on a boat and go check out. Some of the beaches are honestly some of the most beautiful places I’ve ever witnessed. It’s super easy to make friends with travelers, expats, and locals in Bali and its surrounding islands. I also enjoyed Bali itself I surfed every single day, ate super healthy, and met a ton of interesting people from all over the place with tons of unique stories. 

Vietnam would be my second choice after Indonesia.

Go to Indonesia (but not Bali).  Lombok -Kuta, Sengigi or Gilis- (if you like beaches), Jogja (if you like culture), or Bandung (if you like hiking and mountains).  They LOVE the Korean people and are extremely hospitable and friendly. Very very affordable. Some people never leave.

Come to Malaysia, most Malaysian speak very fluent English. (And its common for middle class family to speak english) They are very friendly and would be happy to help you out if you need any help.

If you’re into food, Malaysian is heaven for food lovers. The food is so diverse and you get to eat indian, chinese and malay cuisine. 

Why Malaysia >>>>> other Southeast Asian countries?

1. It’s safe. 4th safest country in asia
2. No natural disasters 
3. Has good highway connectivity and infrastructure 
4. No language barrier (Mandarin and English are widely spoken)
5. Has beaches
6. Not too many tourists (compared to Thailand)
7. Local would love to be friends with you (especially foreigners)
8. Its cheap. Kuala Lumpur is cheaper than Bangkok, Singapore, Phnom Penh etc…

Vietnam is awesome but you need to be willing to move. Chang Mai is great but you stayed for a month? There’s loads of great places in Northern Thailand. Move with a group you like and that can easily be 2/3 weeks with the same people and you see more of the country. 

The other option is work in a hostel, you’ll still have lots of people coming and going but some of the other hostel workers maybe a bit more long term if they love a place.

        The people are SO friendly. And regarding the religious aspect, there are several Christian majority provinces and of course Bali is majority Hindu. 

I do find Indonesia, like Malaysia, to be follow a much gentler form of Islam, than say the ME. Very similar to southern Thailand. i.e, not imposing strict laws on foreigners.

    Indonesia is so extremely different. The sole fact they’re a (very religious) Muslim country, which is fine but they’re sooo different from Thailand lol. Maybe the nature is similar because of the climate, but other than that not sure what you’re refering to.

        I actually don’t find Indonesian to be in your face religious like the UAE or Saudi for example. When travelling to those places, I need to be very aware of how I act, what I wear etc.

And as I said in my above comment, there are several provinces in Indonesia that aren’t Muslim majority at all. You’ll see more churches than mosques.

The OP mentioned activities and food. Going by that, I definitely think Indonesia is comparable and in some ways even exceeds Thailand.

                But southern Thailand is majority Muslim, as are some of the islands around Phuket. Regarding Malaysia some states are a lot more strict with Islamic law than others, but I’ve never felt uncomfortable being a Western tourist. 

In Indonesia if you go East from Lombok, you’ll barely see anyone wearing even a hijab. 

I definitely know what you mean about the different “feel” in Thailand due to it being majority Buddhist, but again, the OP wasn’t asking those questions. 

I grew up in the region and think Indonesia is underrated with the majority of travellers focusing on Bali and Lombok to a smaller extent. 

But there are literally thousands of islands to explore and except for call to prayer and halal food, I don’t feel religion imposed on me.

                        Bali is a Hindu island, which would explain the difference compared to say Lombok, which is known as the island of a thousand mosques.

I've never felt safer really than going around Malaysia, because the people are so friendly and inquisitive as to why foreigners go there it is quite sweet really and some of the mosques in Kuala Lumpur are architecturally amazing.

The scenery in the north of Vietnam around Sapa/Ha Giang are sights I've never seen matched before or since and is a good time to go before it becomes even more overly commercialised.

I've been to Thailand and the Philippines, but not Vietnam. Love Thailand (same route as you). Here's what I can say about the Philippines...if you love the beach and activities centered around the water, it's the most beautiful place I've been to. Coming from the US, I've had people ask me "should I go to XYZ place? the beaches look beautiful." Most of the time I say the Carribean or Bahamas has some of the nicest beaches in the world if thats what you're looking for...but after going to the Philippines, I was blown away.

The islands, water, beaches...stunning.

Depends what you like to do. Philippines for beaches/nature but Vietnam for food, cultural things. I live in Thailand but enjoy all of SEA. 

I’d really consider Indonesia though, especially if you like dramatic landscapes like volcanos, waterfalls. Indonesia is crazy diverse and has some of the most epic nature in the world. The people are also really kind and the food is decent (better than PH but not as good as Thailand or Vietnam IMO).

Might consider Malaysia or Vietnam, as they can be reached via trains from Thailand! And a train journey in Southeast Asia is a really interesting experience (slow ofc, but providing you with good opportunity to immersively experience the local culture and charm)

Comment:
I (35M, Dutch) haven't been to Thailand, but I did visit Vietnam for a month a Philippines for a total of 5 months, spread out over several trips and years with my Filipino fiancée. Some highlights I can mention below.

Vietnam is a country that wants to develop. The infrastructure is there, the people are eagerly learning English, they are used to foreigners/backpackers (wrt to power distance and upping the price) and it has a (recent) history with a lot to offer.
Philippines is pretty much stagnant. Nobody really knows or wants to invest in improving the country as a whole to make it easier, nice, and more to do for a visit. Corruption and inefficiency in every (political) layer makes all development grind to a standstill.

>because of the food and range of activities available. 
If activities is your thing; go for Vietnam. Museums, sights and nature to see, history, motorbike tours, ...
Philippines has mostly water based activities (island tours, boat tours, snorkeling, diving, fish feeding, whale shark watching, etc). 

>I was thinking of my next trip being either Thai + Viet or Thai + Philippines.

Travel wise; Thailand and Vietnam are almost land connected, and Vietnam is pretty much 1 country. It's a country with trains, planes, and plenty of (private) bus/van connections available. To me, it felt like almost everybody knows a person to bring you from a to b, even overnight if needed. In other words; travel is easy, accessible and it gets done.
Philippines on the other hand; it's ~7000 island, mostly connected thru ferries (slow roll on, roll off one), or planes. Most of the tourist area are far apart (palawan, cebu region, siargao, manila/luzon,..) and always require a plane, taxi, tricycle combo to get to the next place. Transport over water is weather sensitive and a typhon sensitive country. Loading and unloading of a ferry can take ages (load capacity reached, overstacked, tetris puzzle getting cargo off,..). Even going to next island easily takes a day, and is a huge energy drainer in my experience. And I'm saying that even with a Filipino on my side doing all the works.

    Reply:1
    Those 5 hour vans from Puerta Princesa to El Nido are the least enjoyable journeys you can have, besides maybe a boat from Bali to Lombok followed by the taxi to the south of the island. 

Stick 14 people in a van made for 8, then if you're unlucky to be at the back row and be tall, you have everyone's luggage on your head for the duration. 

Wouldn't want to do that again.

I've been visiting Thailand for the last 12 years and it is amazing but it's definitely not stand-alone. I loved Vietnam, culture, food, activities and in a lot of areas, not so jaded by tourism but my favourite was sri lanka, mixture or rural and tourism, such kind people, being invited to eat with family and a few visits to the same restaurant and bar and you're treated like a local. Very very cultural but still a stone throw from pool bar resorts, ziplines, windsurfing, elephant hotels.. definitely worth a look 👌

BORACAY beach is stunning.

    So why not just go to less popular areas if you don’t want touristy? As someone who has traveled all over the country to random places with my Thai wife, I can tell you most of Thailand is still surprised to see foreigners. The problem is everyone goes to the same 20 places they saw online.

Every country has it's own culture, landscapes and scenery, activities for tourists etc.  It really depends on what you are interested in.   I don't care about beaches but do love museums and ancient history, and every country has that for me (except Phils but it's top of many lists of people who like beaches)

Make your trip Vietnam+Philippines! Go to Vietnam for the food. For the Philippines, food is great also but avoid Manila (or just pass through) and go straight to the beaches!

How about Thai + Cambodia. I love Cambodia but didn't see nearly enough of it. The food is very similar to Thai but somehow better. You can travel by train between the two countries and Vietnam is an easy add-on.

Thai Viet is better for price and location is better too

I highly recommend Cambodia if you are interested in SE Asia. The food is not as good as in Thailand but the people, the amazing temples and overall vibe of the place is wonderful. Ive been twice and would happily go again. I know you asked about other countries so really just mentioning this as another place to look in to.

    Ironically, it's the one I wouldn't recommend personally as I didn't have a good time. I found Angkor Wat amazing and the S21/Killing Fields to be very interesting, but I didn't find the locals friendly at all. Left for Vietnam pretty quickly.

That being said, I did only visit the main two cities, and I could be tempted to go again to smaller places to see the scenery, but not for a long time.

        Reply:2
        It may well be different now as I was there more than 10 years ago and the place has exploded with tourists. One person’s must see is often another’s never again! I had a terrible time in Morocco for example and find it difficult to understand why people rate it in their top 5 places to travel. 😊

            Reply:3
            Ironically went to both last year. Enjoyed Marrakech a lot 😂

The scams and being shown argan oil every 30 seconds can be annoying, but the food, busy streets and scenery of the atlas mountains were amazing. 

My big issue with Cambodia was the aggressiveness of the tuk tuk drivers trying to offer me sex. I don't mind being stopped but to be actively followed really made me feel uncomfortable. Then a friend I'd met backpacking in a few places arrived at a hotel the day before me in Phnom Penh and had his phone stolen within 4 minutes of being in the city, losing 3 months worth of photos as he never backed anything up. When I saw him about 2 weeks later he seemed much happier in Vietnam 😂

                In my experience in Vietnam the ppl where way less friendly then in Cambodia haha 

Besides Phnom penh.. that was horrible and not a place i would visit again. The rest of Cambodia was great

                    Siem Reap can go into the deepest depth of hell imo. I found the friendliest people in SEA were for the most part Muslim Malaysian women. They had a curiosity that didn't feel like they wanted something out of me, which is my least favourite trait in people there. Filipinos as well are class - do love them.

                Reply:4
                Wow - Im so sad to read this. I had the most incredibly lovely tuk tuk drivers when I was there with my husband and son who was 6 at the time. Maybe the "family dynamic" meant we were shielded from the sex tourism offers. Everyone was just friendly, helpful and kind. You remind me that there were plenty of good things about Morocco - agree that the Atlas mountains were stunning and I loved bustle of all the cities. I just hated being accosted by men all the time and feeling really threatened and unsafe. We were travelling as a group of 4 women in their 20s and attracted way too much attention....

                    Reply:5
                    I think the family dynamic in Cambodia would be a lot more respected than overweight solo white man in their 30s. 

I can see it with Morocco 100% - I have female friends who really don't like it for the same reason. It's almost like Turkey was about 25-30 years ago in attitude.

                        Reply:6
                        Exactly. I went to Turkey as part of the same backpacking trip but it was after Morocco so we thought it was a breeze in comparison. Same with Egypt…which I think might be more problematic for females to travel in these days than it was in the 90s.

                            I know my dad's always refused to go to Istanbul after a friend of his went in the early 90s and his wife was basically harassed the whole time. Didn't show the enthusiasm when I came back and ranted how good it was, so had to accept it in the end.

                                Reply:8
                                I really liked Turkey too. I still tell people how awesome the breakfasts were. As a backpacker- paying a dollar for a massive plate of assorted lovely things was just the best. And Istanbul was amazing… I really need to get out and do some traveling again!

As someone who has traveled extensively in these countries, the Philippines stands out as the one place I don't want to return to. Unlike Thailand or Vietnam, the food in the Philippines was really really not great, and everything is significantly more expensive. What you pay there gets you about a quarter of the quality you’d find in Thailand or Vietnam, whether it’s food, accommodation, or goods. After three months, it was the only country where I was genuinely glad to leave. In contrast, Thailand and Vietnam always left me wanting more.

Aside from the beaches, which have mostly turned into crowded tourist traps, there's little that truly sets the Philippines apart. The rural areas are stunning, but you can experience similar beauty in Vietnam. Another aspect that made my experience less immersive was the strong influence of U.S. culture in the Philippines. From media and music to people’s attitudes, much of it mirrors the U.S., which took away some of the magic of discovering a new and unique culture.

Go and experience all three and you will be the judge what you like and don’t like. Each person experience different things visiting there. Some stayed at nice hotel with superb service and some stayed at hostel. If you are willing to go on the same exact trip on things someone else did then it will easy to compare if not then the advices you are seeking won’t justify your experiences.

You can explore the Philippines—there are many undiscovered or underrated spots that, when you see them, may even look more beautiful than the popular or commercialized tourist destinations. I watched this YouTube video, and I’ve been to some of these places as well. I can say they are definitely worth visiting. And Filipino can speak fluent in English so language barrier is not an issue there.

The people you talked to were right. Apart from Laos and Vietnam, I hit up multiple SEA countries with my then gf, now wife. Thailand seemed the most fun, most liberating, and Thailand had access to beaches from all sides. Seemed like public beach access in the Philippines wasn't a thing.

I have a stupid question, please don’t hate me…how do you manage seeing all the dogs on the streets and not die of sadness…and the little kids begging for food…i want to go but these are the things holding me back 😞

    Reply:1
    I don't know why you're being downvoted, it is sad but it's not something you see that much in Thailand with the children, I certainly haven't anyway. I did in India and Sri Lanka, though. As for the dogs, I deal with it with dog treats, you're not supposed to go near them but I do, I offer out a hand and if they want a cuddle they let me know and if they don't, I leave them be but not found one I couldnt win over yet, the locals feed them from the food stands so much so, they wouldnt take ham off me 😂

    Reply:1
    Most of beggars are Cambodian who illegally come to Thailand, Thai news always report about it. You shouldn’t give them money because it’s supporting human trafficking. Btw about the dogs, at least they have a chance to live while in developed first world countries, if nobody adopt them in time, they gonna be killed.

Congratulations and thank you for the breakdown. I have planned to do this twice in my life, and was very, very close to pull the trigger when I was 30ish, but never went ahead with it. I am now in my early 40s and doubt I will ever have the chance again.

    Reply:1
    Hey now, never say never! We met plenty of travelers on the road that were 40-50s+ It was very inspiring and definitely made me realize we will continue to travel for the rest of our lives. If we do another extended trip, we will probably be about 40 or so when we do it.

        Reply:2
        You are right, but there are several reasons I don't think it will happen for me. I have a dog now and I would never be able to leave her alone for such an extended period. I also believe it will be much harder to find a job after a sabbatical at 45+ than it would be for someone in their early 30s. Last but not least, travel is and will always be a big part of my life. By the time I would have the opportunity for travel long-term, I might not have that many "easy" destinations left, and my ultimate goal is to explore most of what this planet has to offer.

Dude, that 10-month trip across 7 continents?! Seriously epic. Major props for pulling that off. Saving that much AND landing back on your feet job-wise? You guys crushed it.

Your liveaboard costs sound really cheap. Were they last minute deals also? Which boats did you go on?

    Reply:1
    The Maldives liveaboard was a deal, yes. We got it 50% off [liveboard.com](http://liveboard.com) and booked it maybe a week or so out. It was $3948 for both of us on the Emperor Serenity, 8d/7n - maybe around 17/18 dives? The vis wasn't as quite as good as we hoped (went in dec) but we saw mantas, a whale shark, and the boat was really, really nice. Definitely our favorite of the two liveaboards. 

The similan islands liveboard in Thailand was not a deal, it was $2353 for both of us on the Mandarin Queen, 5d/4n, 15 dives. We were the only non-asians on this boat, haha. This one was A LOT in a short amount of time, pretty exhausting honestly but Richelieu Rock is gorgeous, so many fish.

Comment:
Wow, this is truly inspiring. Hats off to you guys for pulling this off. May I ask about the health aspect behind your travel stories, did you get enough rest, were you feeling tired especially during the plane rides. Were you still continuing on with your fitness routines? If you have any tips on how you managed your health during this entire time, it will be really helpful. The day of flying is so exhausting to me and usually the next day is also spent on taking rest. I want to get better at enjoying these too.

    Reply:1
    We were really fortunate that we didn't have any health issues while traveling, other than a few stomach bugs and once I did have a really high fever for a week and that wiped me out. We've always been reasonably fit but didn't really have a fitness routine or anything. We walk A LOT so I'm sure that helped. But I guess our bodies just adjusted to all of the flying?? haha we've always been go go go people and don't have any issues flying then immediately walking somewhere and being active. I always make sure to drink lots of water/apple juice on the plane to stay hydrated, never alcohol while flying. We're also typically in bed by 10pm and make sure to be well rested for activities. 

I would say we started to feel exhaustion from the trip around the time we got to Taipei and did have a lot of rest days through there/Singapore/Thailand/Kuala Lumpur haha We also prioritized comfortable airbnb stays with a couch/good AC etc to make sure we were able to just chill at night if we wanted to.

        Reply:2
        That's so great, thank you for sharing this. I think being that go go go kinda active person helps even more on trips. Sometimes my mind and body just won't cooperate to get up and go 😂 I have felt that being reasonably fit is a such a big requirement for traveling.

How did you come across the deal for Antartica?

    We used a company called Wayfinders Adventures that emails deals out. We bought it 3 weeks out. They also loaned us snow pants and gloves which was helpful since we weren’t coming from home. There’s also a company called Freestyle that does the same thing/has the same deals. Our trip was through Albatros Expeditions and well worth the price.

    It's so hard to say because we loved all of it! But probably the W Trek (gorgeous hiking), month long road trip around New Zealand, and we did a 3d/2n snorkel cruise around the Komodo Islands. Japan is probably our favorite country, we had been there once prior to this trip. And then decided to go twice during this trip because we love it so much.

Your title says East Asia which is generally used to refer to Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan, and does not include Southeast Asia.

-----------------------------
Comment:
First thing first, South East Asia and East Asia are two different places. East Asia includes China, Japan and Korea. You're going to South East Asia. 

Jakarta is an interesting choice for a first timer to say the least. Alcohol is expensive in Indonesia, so it's good that you're not a drinker. Do check the weather. I think it's the rainy season there in January, possibly the wettest month. 17-day isn't a lot. Bali and Java are also quite far away from the rest of SEA.

If you do mind the rain, fly to KL or Penang then do island hoppings from Langkawi, Malaysia to various islands in Southern Thailand. Fly to Bangkok and end your trip in Jakarta before going home.

    Reply:1
    Sorry, a typo on my part. I’m indeed going to Southeast Asia. 

Yeah, Jakarta has an interesting feedback. People love or hate it or just completely avoid it. I fly in about 5:30 pm and I fly to Jakarta because I got a good deal.

Yeah, that’s not a bad idea. I might check that out. Thanks for the suggestion.

-----------------------------
Comment:
If it's your first time in SE Asia, I think it is a bit ambitious. Indonesia is probably not a good place to start and you might be unpleasantly overwhelmed. Thailand has much better tourist infrastructure.

Also, most countries in the world would be hard to check out in 2-3 days as you mentioned you planned for Vietnam. Vietnam is a large country of over 100 million people and a few distinct regions.

I'd recommend you focus on one big city and one chill island destination in a single country with 2 weeks time. Like, fly to Bangkok and check it out for 4-5 days and then do 10 days or so in southern Thailand. Or do something similar in Vietnam.

    Reply:1
    On reflection, I agree with you. It’s probably too ambitious and I probably have factored into how long it takes to get from one city  to another city. I’m based in London and internal flights within Europe and the UK are very quick. 

So what I’m thinking I do a night Inkaar take a plane to Bali for three days Bali to Thailand explore crabby Bangkok maybe one night in Singapore and then back to Jakarta

I haven't been to Indonesia, but I do love Thailand. I would recommend spending time in Krabi. I loved the place, and you could go Island Hopping and to Railey Beach. All the places are wonderful. Honestly, Singapore is quite small, but there is so much you can do. I loved both of the places!

Any tips of Bangkok?  I’ve heard the massages are super affordable.

        i usually travel one country at a time as i want to fully experience local life! but if you need to pick three for me - indonesia (just because of your flight), thailand, vietnam). 

java if you are interested to go hiking, otherwise go straight to bali! 

for beaches - hands down Philippines - boracay/palawan. Krabi - is nice, Bali is just water(wahahahaha). you go there for the vibe🤣

bali,bangkok, vietnam will spoil you with good food! very cheap! 

Singapore - not my choice as i can go there during layover.

reco - bkk - octave rooftop, tichuca rooftop bar. speakeasy bars - find the photobooth and find the lockerroom. food - wattana panich, phed mark! izakaya type - fatboy🤣

Don't bother spending your short time in Jakarta, I'd head straight down to Bandung or Yogyakarta, then go on from there. Or fly from Jakarta to Medan and explore Sumatra - Sumatra quite awesome IMHO.  Perhaps near the end of your trip you could fly Bali->Singapore, explore Singapore for a day or 2 then fly to Jakarta.

    Reply:1
    OP is already flying all the way from London to Jakarta and arriving in the late afternoon. I think the last thing they would want to do is to immediately get on a train to go straight to another destination.

And Jakarta is a great city to explore for a day or two with plenty to see and do. Fantastic food scene there. Let the influencer cunts stay in Bali or Gili T while those willing to take a step off the beaten path enjoy the delights of the capital.

        Reply:2
        Yes sure there is good food, but that is true of basically everywhere in SEA.  I've spent many weeks in Jakarta, it's not bad, personally I prefer to spend my time in just about any other city in Indonesia.  But I agree after a 20+ hour flight after landing in JKT all I also would want to do is grab a bite have a very long sleep!

    I land around 5.30pm  Jakarta. Thinking of maybe getting some shut eye after 20+ our flight then head in the morning onwards. I may fly directly to Bali then Thailand. Will do Singapore for a night

My suggested 17 days in SE Asia

Congrats on the good deal flight to Jakarta. Now leave Jakarta 😄 Go spend 3-4 jet lag recovery days in Bali. They also have a major international airport there, so no need to go back through Jakarta for your next stops. 

Bali -> Singapore. I know a lot of people think Singapore is boring. It’s like the Zurich of Asia - but if you’re a foodie, it’s a must-stop. Great food town. 2-3 days in Singapore

Singapore —> Georgetown, Malaysia (Penang). Foodtopia tour continues. 3 days here

Penang -> Phuket/Krabi for 3 days

Phuket -> Bangkok for 3 days

If you’re done now - fly back home. If you had cut back the time a bit (2 days instead of 3, etc) - you may be able to squeeze one more stop in. Do you have to fly back through Jakarta?

    Reply:1
    Thank you for your suggestion. That’s really helpful.

I will spend a night because I arrive at 5:30. I land in Jakarta after a 20+ our flight. 

And your recommendations for places in that you can suggest in Bali. 

I have a few people from a company that work in Singapore so I may catch up with them when I’m there. 

Your itinerary has given me a lot to think about

        Reply:2
        Yeah that’s fair. Get some recovery zzz’s in Jakarta before moving on. 

I’ll let others make Bali suggestions - I tend to be in the “off the beaten path / unplug/ hide from people in the jungle” camp - so someplace like Cepik Villa in Sidemen.  But you might want a more typical beach resort hustle/bustle experience near town. For a trip like yours you might want to alternate between rural and major city. I tend to get burnt out if it’s just city city city

            Reply:3
            Yep and dude what a suggestion. In my head, I just think Bali is a party place. That villa looks amazing and may go ahead and book it.

Looks like a great place just switch off. Silly question what did you read from Bali to get to that villa?

                Reply:4
                I just do whatever the New York Times 36 Hours travel column tells me to 😂

Oh - and in Singapore - be sure to try Kaya toast and the vending machine that sells slices of cake in a jar. I’m obsessed with that vending machine.

You don’t necessarily need to “return” to Jakarta to get to Thailand. There are direct flights from Bali to Bangkok and Phuket. So that may free up a day of your itinerary. Still, if you truly intend to “explore” Java and Bali and spend a week in Thailand, you’re not going to have time for a day in Singapore, let alone 2-3 days in Vietnam on top of that. Just count it out: 2 days in Jakarta; at least 2 in Yogyakarta to see the temples and palaces; presumably you then want to hike Mt. Bromo, which will require another 2 based on what I’ve read; now you’re left with 4 days in Bali to allocate however you choose; then a week in Thailand makes 17. Have a great time regardless of what you decide.

    Reply:1
    Thanks for your comments. I think someone suggestions if you like hiking than skin Java. I normally do but limited on time and want to have something more chilled.

Yeah, I’m gonna try and break it down . Maybe a night in Jakarta spend two days in Bali or three days then go to Thailand and then maybe do a day in Singapore.

Thank you once again

        Reply:2
        I’m not sure what they mean by that. Java is huge. There’s plenty of good hiking across the island. Anyway, looking at your responses to other comments, I would suggest taking some time to think about what you really want to see and do on this trip, then map it out using various tools like Google Maps and Google Flights to get an idea of driving distances, flight times, airport locations, etc., and recognizing that every new location will add transit time, planning time, packing time, airport waiting time and more that’ll eat into your actual vacation time. Seventeen days will fly by quickly. Have as much fun as you can.

            Reply:3
            Sorry, a big typo my part. The person mentioned Java is great for hiking and for this trip I’m not feeling like a huge hike basically.

Thank you for the advice and taken fully on board and this is gonna be an amazing trip

    Paris fireworks are at Arc de Triomphe / Champs-Élysées. It gets really crowded and honestly you can’t really see the fireworks if you’re not there a couple of hours early. Got there three hours early last year. Was freezing and couldn’t see much 

Would not recommend anyone to make the trip to Paris just to see the NYE fireworks. It can get really cold and honestly might not end up being worth it

Paris - cold and often pretty gloomy. Phenomenal restaurants if you are really into fine dining. World class art museums.
The city is pretty that time of the year because of the Christmas decorations and then the new year. 
You will be with a local so you should have a great experience with Parisians. 🙄

Thailand - lovely temps as long as you are good with humidity. 
Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket all great in their own ways. 
Very interesting culture, great food, affordable. 
Get a local guide your age to introduce you to the sights but also the non-tourist sides of Thailand - great place to celebrate and play.

You don’t lose either way 🙂

Bangkok for sure. You’ll both go somewhere you haven’t been for the holidays which I think is better. The night life in Paris kinda sucks right now and there are aggy vibes in the club industry atm. (Events being cancelled last minute because of promoter feuds and police being involved etc.) 
I’ve been to all places you mentioned and Thailand is one of my favourite places to visit. The food there is great too. You’ll be able to sightsee more and do more activities.

Had NYE in BKK a couple of years ago. It was fun but book ahead. That year the Main Street party in Koshan Rd was cancelled. The good bars and party’s were all fully booked several days in advance and it’s not as cheap as you might think that night. We still found a good place to be but definitely could have done better with planning earlier. The night markets have all but disappeared now but it’s still super fun, and warm!

Well, one argument for Paris could perhaps be that you could maybe spend some time with your BF's side of the family? That might make it more special in that sense. 

But no doubt that Thailand is warmer during winter and probably more pleasant weather-wise.

    This is the type of insight I was looking for! We were looking at doing a champagne tour in Reims on the morning of the 31st,  then meet up with some friends for a masquerade party at night, and walk to the fireworks. But if it's anything like NYE in NYC with the ball drop, I wouldn't even bother 💀

KL is better for English speaking. Bangkok is better for nightlife IF you know where you go (avoiding tourist areas).

Bangkok is a bit cheaper. Beer especially!

Depends on the month. As they are opposite sides of the peninsula, they have different wet seasons.

Thailand I would say food is generally better, or it's easier to get good food. Beaches are better at Samui vs Langkawi. There might be a boat to a Thai island from Langkawi so you could do that as well so you visit both countries.

    Reply:1
    The boat from Langkawi takes you to Koh Lipe. It's an extremely small island, but has great scuba diving locations.

I live in Malaysia and the answer ImHO is Thailand is cheaper also better service culture and food.

Bangkok has far better transport, and many, many more interesting places to see and the food is first class.

        To me.  I liked KL better.  Bangkok was awesome but I hated that as a single man I couldn’t go anywhere after dark without being approached endlessly by ladies of the night and tuk tuks and etc.  KL didn’t have as much cool stuff, but it was less stressful.

            Reply:3
            If you are worried about getting approached by LotN, you are hanging around the wrong areas. As for TukTuks, ignoring them works fine. I get just as much hassle down at Bukit Bintang. From hawkers and also plenty of very dodgy LotN

                I mean, I was just in the area around my hotel which is the tourist area.  I was probably four blocks from Soi Cowboy, which is one of the epicenters for sure, but how far away does one need to go?   Bangkok during the day is cool, the food is amazing, but sometimes I just want to go have a beer and people watch without an endless stream of people coming up to me for various reasons. I could get that in KL, not in Bangkok.  I was in the tourist area of both.  It’s cool to disagree man, they are both good cities.

Both options sound fantastic, and it really depends on what kind of experience you're looking for. Having spent time in both Malaysia and Thailand, here’s my take:

**Kuala Lumpur & Langkawi**  
KL is indeed vibrant and full of life. With 48 hours, you’ve probably just scratched the surface. Spending another 2 nights there would give you more time to explore the mix of modern and traditional aspects of the city. From the bustling street markets to the iconic Petronas Towers, there’s plenty to see and do. After that, heading to Langkawi for 5 days sounds like a perfect balance. Langkawi is all about relaxation—beautiful beaches, clear waters, and just the right amount of laid-back island vibe. You can unwind, maybe go for a sunset cruise or explore the mangroves. It’s a great spot if you’re looking to recharge with a mix of nature and serenity.

**Bangkok & Koh Samui**  
Bangkok, on the other hand, is a whole different energy. The city is chaotic in the best way possible, with an endless list of things to see and do—from temples and markets to rooftop bars and street food that’ll blow your mind. Spending 2 nights here will give you a taste of its intensity. Then, moving on to Koh Samui for 5 days offers a nice contrast. Koh Samui is stunning, with its palm-fringed beaches, vibrant nightlife (if you’re into that), and opportunities for some serious relaxation. Whether you want to explore waterfalls, chill on the beach, or even take a day trip to nearby islands, Koh Samui has a lot to offer.

**So, which to choose?**  
If you’re after a bit more variety and don’t mind the contrast between city hustle and beach chill, the Bangkok and Koh Samui combo is hard to beat. You’ll get a mix of culture, food, and relaxation.

But if you’re leaning towards a more laid-back trip with just a touch of city exploration and then a deep dive into beach relaxation, the KL and Langkawi option might be more up your alley. Plus, Langkawi’s quiet charm is perfect if you’re looking to truly unwind.

Both choices are solid, so it really depends on the vibe you’re going for!

Both are awesome but it depends on your vibe tho. I would say Malaysia is super chill w diverse food (nasi lemak, roti canai, curry laksa etc.. ) & cool cities like KL + epic nature (Borneo & Cameron Highlands) while Thailand is all about beaches, parties & temples? great if u r looking for nightlife/ cheap backpacking..

    The shariah law literally does nothing to foreigners and to the locals? The country use civil law like any other countries in the world, and shariah law mainly consist of marriage, divorce and child custody among muslim couples. And also, Malaysia doesn't work like a middle east muslim country, for example like Afghanistan or Iran where alot things are heavily forced upon the citizen.

    Eh... pretty no one in Egypt will grab you by the junk, which is a regular thing I've had happen in Thailand many times. Ping pong shows are pretty bad, masseuses somehow even worse.

You'll definitely have people follow you down the street more in places like Morocco or Cairo, but it's a.. different kind of soliciting, depending on who you are, where you are, and what is being solicited. 

I've had multiple masseuses lock arms and physically try to pull me into their shops in Phuket, so I definitely don't agree they "leave you alone". You can laugh it off pretty safely (just watch your wallet..), but it happens.

            It's fine — usually more amusing than anything else, and sometimes they're having a bit of a laugh with it. Nothing will happen. It's pretty aggressive soliciting nonetheless, whether you like your dong being grabbed or not. 

Generally speaking, any novelty you think it might have wears off pretty quick when you're just headed out to grab a sandwich and they won't leave you alone.

            Yeah, one is interpretably physical assault, while the other is interpretably harrassment. I'm not saying I'd prefer to be followed down the street, I just don't think it's fair to dismiss soliciting in Thailand as "extremely mild" when I've literally had hands shoved down my pants and been barricaded from moving forward. 

Again, it really depends on who you are, where you are, and what is being solicited. Bangla Road is a totally different world from Khao San.

                    >Yeah you are not being ‘physically assaulted’ by the tiny Thai lady

Race and gender don't generally have any bearing on whether something is physical assault. When walking down Bangla Road at 2AM, you should certainly be *prepared* for this kind of thing to happen, and it is normalized there — but that doesn't make it unaggressive soliciting, nor does it exempt it from being interpretably (as I said before) physical assault. You won't find the same thing happening in *De Wallen* for a reason. 

It's fine, and you get used to it as a tourist. I've been to about a hundred counties, and there's worse stuff in the world. It's still quite aggressive soliciting, by any reasonable definition.

Normal for tourist area's. During the first month had the same experiences. After one month a friend who was born in Thailand came over to join, from the Netherlands. He thought us one word/sentence and the aggressive shop owners didn't bother us anymore.

As others are saying, it depends where you go - busier tourist places are worse obviously. Wouldn't say they're aggressive though, and I've been all over Thailand. Sure sometimes a bar girl will try and grab your arm and pull you in, or a waiter will walk alongside you with a menu trying to talk you into coming in, but you just have to smile and say no, and keep walking and they'll leave you alone.

Just been in SE Asia including Thailand. Bangkok and Hua Hin. Stayed near the river in Bangkok and then in the centre.

No remotely aggressive soliciting in either place (including the weekend market). Basically no soliciting at all unless you include friendly, elderly masseuses calling out “sir, massage?” Tuk tuk guys in Hua Hin were great and generally needed to be waved over. So no - you just went to the absolutely seediest parts of Bangkok and Phuket.

Phuket and Bangkok are like this, yes. You chose the wrong areas.

My only trip to Thailand was in 1996, so a lot has changed. However, even back then Phuket had a bad reputation, but was and still is the town foreigners often aim for. There are other places in Thailand to consider. Of course even they have become more touristy. Perhaps Ko Samui or Ko Phangan may still be better?

Another place to try is Kanchanaburi, the site of The River Kwai, known more by British than Americans. Again, I'm unsure how it's changed, but there's clearly much more to do there now than when I was there.

100% agree!  I don't know if it's normal for Thailand, but it's normal for Bangkok.  It's one of the things about Bangkok that I actively dislike and one of the reasons that I avoid visiting.  Basically, everyone you meet wants something from you, and solicits it aggressively, and it's very tiring and off-putting.  Yes, this happens in other countries also, but in Bangkok it's an order of magnitude worse.

Someday I hope to visit other cities in Thailand to give them a chance, but I'm done with Bangkok.

Comment:
Yup, it's the norm.

Instead of Hue or Da Nang, seriously consider Ninh Binh - even if you just go for 1 full day to experience the scenery. It was one of my favourite places not just in Vietnam, but all of SE Asia. The karst landscape is insane.

    Hadn't been recommended this until this post, thanks for the recommendation!

        I've visited Vietnam twice, the first time I skipped Ninh Binh so made sure to go there the next time and I am so glad I did.

Also Dalat is one of the coolest places in Vietnam, I've been twice and would happily go again.

If you want a ridiculous day out, visit Ba Na Hills from Da Nang, it's kind of everything I hate but I absolutely loved it.

            Reply:3
            How long did you do Ninh Binh for? Would it be rushed in a day trip?

                Reply:4
                I spent 2 nights there which was a good amount of time to see everything, but you could do it as 1 night stopover between Hanoi and Hue. I really mean Tam Coc when I say Ninh Binh btw, Ninh Binh is the town near it, but Tam Coc is where you want to visit and stay in and the bus stops there. The main things to do is the boat trip and the viewpoint, but I enjoyed just exploring all the different roads and seeing the different temples, caves and landscapes.

Day 1: Bus from Hanoi to Ninh Binh is around 2 hours. Do a boat trip down the river which takes about 2 hours. Wander around Tam Coc, explore a little bit, spend the night.

Day 2: Walk up to the viewpoint, see Mua cave. You can rent bikes or get a short taxi to get here. Explore a bit more, maybe Bich Dong Pagoda. Get on the overnight bus to Hue.

Replace Ha Long Bay with Ninh Binh

    Thanks. Would it work as a day trip from Hanoi or would you stay over?

        It's worth 2 days and 1 night, then you can take an overnight bus or train from Ninh Binh to Hue.

Ha long bay is a long day at most. A day trip from Hanoi. Could prob lose a day in Bangkok. Maybe even a day in chiang mai.

You plan on doing a overnight cruise in Ha Long? A lot of people here are saying skip it but I say to go to Bai Tu bay. It’s a part of Ha Long but away from the hundreds of ship more secluded and what Ha Long use to be.

    Reply:1
    I have been interested in the Ha Long cruise - to be clear, do you mean do Bai Tu as a part of the cruise or on its own thing?

        Reply:2
        Bai Tu Bay is part of greater Ha Long Bay. It’s just a little further out. It’s like going to the Grand Canyon but instead of the main parking area where the tour buses are at you go a mile up the road away from the crowds. I did an overnight cruise to Bai Tu Bay. There were maybe another 4 cruise ships there. You can book it while in Hanoi.

            Reply:3
            The correct name is BAI TU LONG Bay

I'd lose a day in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Saigon and especially (at *least* one day) in Hoi An and use that time up in Ha Giang instead.

        I tacked on an extra day there just because I was pretty tired at that point in my trip.  I did some cycling in the countryside and relaxed at the hotel pool.  Otherwise, I agree that Hoi A doesn’t need much time.

        Reply:2
        I'd spend about three days in Hoi An. It's quite lovely as a bit of a break from travel hustle with a lot of little side activities to do. Sit by the river, have a beer, relax. Watch the sunset. Very romantic place.

    This is excellent advice. Ha giang loop is absolutely amazing, My wife and I did it this year at 58 years old and had a blast.

Skip ha long bay honestly. It’s one day at most. Instead, what I would recommend is to shave another day off of da nang/ hoi an and doing the ha giang loop for three days. Best experience of my life.

You could use one less day in hcm and be fine.

4 days in Bangkok is a lot to be honest. How are you getting around by car or bus? Krabi is a good place to use as a jump off point. Ko phi phi is really a day thing, it’s small…. Plenty of other island around krabi to explore.  Railay is very chill aand offers plenty of excursions

-----------------------------
Comment:
I’d lose a day or two in Bangkok, depending on what time your flight lands/how long your travel day is. I’d lose a day in chang Mai and try and make it out to Pai (northern thailand) for a night or two. Taking a day off in Hanoi and ha long bay, and using that time to travel to Nihn Bihn area (tam coc) specifically. I’d lose a day in da nang 1 night in Da nang is more than enough in my opinion. And I’d lose a day or two in Ho Chi Minh. And I’d use those three days to travel to a little island in the south of Vietnam to chill before the long journey home. Unfortunately I don’t have any recommendations on which island is best.

Literally on a plane back from a two month Southeast Asia trip. Going to echo others and say skip the Ha Long bay cruise, it was our low point.

Please please please go to Railay Beach in Krabi. It’s only accessible by boat, but is just the most incredible beach I’ve ever been to. Most people make a day trip from Krabi, but we stayed on the island feet from the beach. It’s an incredible experience.

    Reply:1
    So you'd recommend staying on Railay over Ao Nang then?

        Reply:2
        Yeah I’d recommend staying on Railay. You can get a boat to Ao Nang pretty easily for a day trip.

I would do Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh, both absolutely incredible.

Recommend doing the overnight cruise for Ha Long Bay

    Have been looking at the overnight cruise. Would you say you get the most out of the area doing it that way? Also, how long would you say for Ninh Binh? Thanks!

        Yeah it’s a pretty long bus journey from Hà Nội to the port. It’s not too bad when it’s spread over two days. Plus being on a ferry at night is chefs kiss for me personally

I'm assuming you're flying between all those locations, otherwise you'll need to modify that plan drastically.   


For Thailand part: Bangkok- Krabi - Chiang Mai is a good order, there are direct flights in-between.   phiphi is a daytrip destination.    


For Vietnam:    


Ha Long - possibly a daytrip or a night on a boat in the bay, definitely not 2 nights there.   


You don't need that much time in Ho chi Minh- I'd recommend just 2 days. It's like Bangkok, but with worse everything.

    Reply:1
    Yeah flying is the main thing. Figured domestic flights with a backpack wouldn't be too much a ball ache!

Phi Phi is now a day trip and it's looking like Ha Long is a nightboat, but undecided between that and day trip.

 Thanks for your help, and the "worse everything" made me laugh!

Comment:
5 days in Da Nang and Hoi An is way too much IMO. 2 full days is enough IMO.

I would work in one full day in Ninh Binh.

    Reply:1
    Ninh Binh has definitely been fit in now. I have removed Da Nang all together, with Hoi An being two days. Is that the right move or any other places in Viet more with that time, in your opinion?

-----------------------------
Comment:
3 nights in Hoi An is a night too long in my opinion. It's pretty small. 1-2 nights is enough.

I would keep all four nights in Bangkok to start the trip because it's a big city with a lot to see and because you will be jet lagged for the first 1-2 days.

I personally don't think Chiang Mai warrants four nights but some people do, and you may be arriving late on the first day if coming from Koh Phi Phi.  I'm seeing one nonstop flight from Krabi  to Chiang Mai and it leaves at 7pm.

    Reply:1
    Yeah Hoi An has been changed to 2 nights now. Exactly my thoughts with Bangkok. Based on what people have said, it looks like Phi Phi is a daytrip now so that makes it easier flight wise :) With the new days opened up, where else in Thailand would you suggest? Any other islands or cities?

        Reply:2
        Well to me the most impressive thing to see in the region is Angkor Wat. There are direct flights from Bangkok to Siem Reap, and there are direct flights from Siem Reap to Hanoi on Vietjet Airlines and Vietnam Airlines.

If you take a day out of Chiang Mai, Hoi An, and Phi Phi, you could fit in three nights in Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples like Beng Melea and Koh Ker.

-----------------------------
Comment:
Like others have said, shave a day off of Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and HCMC each. I would replace Ha Long with Cat Ba island. Same vibes, little quieter. Ninh Binh and Ha Giang are good north Vietnam things to replace the city time as well

    Reply:1
    All of those things have applied, thanks. Ninh Binh is a definite now, however I'm just not sure Ha Giang loop is for me, risk wise. Do you suggest anywhere else to fill the time? Thanks!

        Reply:2
        For Ha Giang, you can get easy riders, and join a tour with a local driving you around. Much safer that way, that's what I did. 


A little harder to get to, but quite beautiful is the Cao Bang Provence, and the Ban Gioc Waterfall. There are 1-2 day tours that you can arrange with your hostel to see that and other stuff in the region 


Near Hue is Phong Nha, which has massive caves and dense jungle  to explore


SaPa is the place for rice paddy hikes and what not. A little touristy, but that's ok. 


Khao Sok Lake in Thailand is quite nice as well


Siem Riep in Cambodia has Angkor Wat, the most impressive ruin complex anywhere in the world. It can be done via overnight busses between Bangkok and HCMC, but flights might be easier. 


Please check the annual weather ahead of time for wherever you go. Phong Nha is flooded for 2 months of the year, Ha Giang is having landslides due to rainy season right now

When you say nature, what kind of things are you looking for? We snorkeled in the Surin islands, visited the Doi inthanon national park, and visited an elephant sanctuary (no riding). You're spending a lot of time in cities; do you want to be out in nature more?


Also at that time, you're right to go to the Andaman sea side of Thailand in the south. The Gulf area has more rain at that time.


The best food we had was in Chaing Mai, Hanoi, and Saigon. Have bun cha in Hanoi if you eat pork - it was amazing!!

    Reply:1
    Thanks for the suggestions. I've since added Ninh Binh and Khao Sok to the itinerary to try and even things out! I think there's an elephant sanctuary in Khao Sok 😄

        Reply:2
        Up to you of course. There are also sanctuaries in Chiang Mai, Koh Samui, and others. Many beautiful elephants to be rescued unfortunately!

Comment:
How are you getting between these places exactly? Have you structured the cities this way for a specific reason? 

You've chosen a lot of big cities, I see, which is fine if that's what you like. I understand the desire to move a lot and see a lot, but you should consider the amount of time you lose by trying to move too often. Time in transit, to and from, time checking in, packing and moving hotels, etc.

Ha long bay is pretty underwhelming, Imo. If you must, just book a day trip from hanoi. Da nang isn't bad but it's not special. In the end, you'll enjoy it no matter what you choose, I'm sure, so no worries, but after a month there, ninh binh was by far the best place I saw. I'd recommend three days there. You could cut hue, da nang, or a couple days from HCMC. 

Ko phi phi is pretty, like Krabi, but it's just like a small Ibiza type thing. The over night trip to phi phi leh is nice, but that's about it. You could save time by skipping it and hitting Koh Phang an before Krabi instead for the full money party, which is more memorable. Turn just fly from Krabi to CM.

    Reply:1
    It's mainly been for the fact that you can fly between them fairly cheaply and easily, and through what my research has deemed the 'have to do' things in these countries. Hence why I wanted to see what everyone had to say. Thanks for the tips!

Vietnam is absolutely worth the trip! An amazing country. We were there for a week and it wasn't enough time! Already thinking about going back. Hanoi is chaotic. Its Asia on hard-mode. Amazing all the way through, but i would not call it relaxing. I would skip Ha Long Bay. We found it crowded and dirty, kind of depressing. Consider Tam Coc- often called Ha Long bay on land. We did both and loved Tam Coc way more. You can rent a car to bring you, its very easy. Just ask your hotel or I can PM you someone we used.

Danang and Hoi an are very close together, maybe just 5 days for the whole thing would be enough.

You can add in somewhere else perhaps, maybe Dalat, or Nha Trang, or Sapa valley, or Phu Quoc for some beach time.

No need for HCMC really.

        Agree w the comment that 8 nights in HA and DN is probably long, given the length of the trip..  I'd  add the two nights during your return turn trip to Ha Noi and use those two nights in Ninh Binh (but you can probably get away w one).  That said, if you want to stay at a nice resort in Da Nang for some R&R such as the Hyatt Regency or Intercontinental, and add day trip to Hue, that probably works too.  They're away enough from the busy city but has direct beach access.  Have a great trip.  You'll have a great time regardless.

Hoi an at most is 2 days 1 night

I would combined danang and hoian into 1 since they are next to each other, or maybe hue id you into history. Hue is top destination for food that you cant find anywhere else. 
And add ho chi minh or southern mekong if you can. The experience will totally be different from north to south.

Comment:
It's a common itinerary like any tour operator would offer. It's likely to be "checkboxes" rather than "relaxed" as you said. In my opinion, you should cut four days from Hoi An and Danang to HCMC due to their proximity.

Comment:
Shorten Hanoi two days at least, shorten Hoi An a day or two , skip Da Nang or just see the important stuff like Marble mountain on way to Hoi An.  Add Ho Chi Minh for a few days and add Hue a few days.  My two cents.  But don't miss Vietnam.

I would hate doing that trip with a suitcase (even Rome would be a pain never mind on and off buses and trains and across uneven paths) and with a day sack as well I would go for the 55l backpack. It will be plenty. But I have never travelled with a suitcase and detest them so am very biased!

I would pack in a carry on backpack (30-40l). No risk of lost luggage, quicker to check in and leave the airports, easier to carry around, and doesn't take much space in a hotel room (and rooms in Japan are tiny). 

Lugging a huge suitcase across 6 countries seems exhausting to me but people have different preferences so you need to figure out what works for you.

If you have a good back, a backpack would be easier to carry around. If your back is messed up, take a suitcase. Also keep in mind that if you plan to take or being back anything breakable, a hard sided suitcase is better. You can also get one of those fold up  rollable luggage carts if needed.

Backpack.  Years back I hooked up with a girl in a hostel in SEA and we ended up traveling around together for about six weeks, she had a rollie suitcase and it was a major pain in the ass for her (and for me since I ended up helping her with it a lot).  The sidewalks are shit, the sides of the crowds can be crowded with scooters and whatever else, there can be gross shit on the ground, go with a backpack 100%.

-----------------------------
Comment:
The two things my wife and I count every day we go out for our walks are bandaged knees (scooter accidents from people who don't bother to learn how to ride in their own country before going to SEA) and wheels torn off of luggage laying on the side of the road or walkway.

I highly recommend using a backpack. Then again, I also recommend keeping the packed weight below 7-kg, as it saves your back, as well as time and money with transportation.

Boracay is tiny. I think after a few days, you'd get bored.

I just spent 3 weeks in Panglao/Bohol, and loved it. Rented a scooter and drove up to the Chocolate Hills. Plenty of great bars and such too keep you entertained in Alona,and the airport is right there, just a few minutes away,and it has flights from Clark, so you can completely avoid Manila. The beaches aren't as lovely as boracay, but they are still lovely.

Palawan El Nido and Coron, has the awesome tropical waters.  Good side trip. 

The bar scene in Thailand is far better than PH.   With the exception of Angeles City, but thats for men only, as it has over 100 girly bars.  It caters to Korean, Japanese, European, Aussie , and of course the American military men.  

Boracay bar scene is small but if you look on satellite google maps, there are several bars along the main beach.

Boracay is probably the most beautiful beach and sea that I have been to. We stayed towards the south which was a bit outside of the busy area. It was also before the government shut the island to tourists for a bit so I assume it is even cleaner now?? But maybe that also affected the other hospitality businesses. We did 3/4 days after touring Luzon and Bohol. I wouldn't stay there for 10 days but that is a personal preference.

I have been to Boracay, it’s beautiful but there isn’t enough for ten days. I did five nights over an Easter a few years ago whilst working in Manila. So it was an inexpensive trip for me because of that.

I spent a month in the Philippines a few years ago including a few days in Boracay over NYE. Big party scene but the island is pretty small so 10 days would be overkill. There's lots to do on Palawan and Cebu so I'd maybe split the 10 days between those. But also factor in that getting from island to island can be a bit to navigate.

You should consider season/weather which will impact how you're able to enjoy the areas. I would think 5-6 days for Sydney, Melbourne and maybe Cairns is a stretch. I feel Cairns is more so a base for excursions into the surrounding areas  so you would need a vehicle or do tours, whereas Sydney and Melbourne you can just get out of your accommodation and explore the city using public transport.

Koh Lipe is cool, liked it better than the nearby Malay coast. Not sure about the prevalence of gay travelers.

Why so many different islands? Are you aware of how much traveling you need to do to see all of this? And how are you traveling? 

In 6 weeks you can see pretty much every highlight in Thailand. I'd swap a few islands for Khao Yai and Erawan.

    Reply:1
    We love islands but yes I’m concerned it might be too much. Planning on using all forms of transport. Will definitely have a look at khao yai and Erawan. Thank you 🙏

        Reply:2
        All forms of transportation is a bit vague. I suggest looking at 12go.asia and have a look at how long it takes to get from one island to the next. With your schedule you spend at least 2 weeks of your holiday on ferries and taxis.

Wow that's alot you need to take into account travelling time u loose with this schedule.

I get you want to see as much as you can but the travelling between places will be a factor

Hello! I just came back from my 4 week thailand travel. I think its too many island, but you can be spontaneous. I would highly recommend Koh Phangan, my partner and I liked this island the most, because its full of nature and exploring things. I can also recommend "The Pier" you sleep in your own bungalow right next to the ocean (not the most beautiful beach, but a very nice feeling in my opinion) you can also rent scooters there for like 7€ per day, which makes the exploring way easier. We also did not like bangkok, 2 nights were enough for us, its very very busy. I personally did not see chang mai or generelly the north of thailand, but every local we talked to recommended us to go there. Hope this helps :)

    Reply:1
    Thank you so much - this is so helpful. Would you mind sharing your itinerary?

        Reply:2
        sure! we started at bangkok and stayed two nights. Then we went to Hua Hin, but this was just because we travelled low budget and did not want to take a flight, was not that beautiful so i would not recommend it (stayed there 3 nights). After that we went to Krabi and stayed there over a week because I had to go to the hospital. I  can recommend the COSI Hotel 10€ per night per person, they have a rooftop pool, you can do your laundry there and the rooms are beautiful for this price. After this we went to Koh Phi Phi. We did not like it there, its full with tourists and a very small island, you can do great snorkeltrips there but thats it (in my opinion). Then we went to Koh Phangan for 1 week. Then to Koh Samui for 5 nights, but this was also very touristic in comparison to koh phangan. Then we took a flight to bangkok and stayed there 2 nights, because our flight home went from bangkok. We also heard only good things from Koh Tao! But did not make it because I was Ill for a week. I wisj you a great time in Thailand and be aware of scams in bangkok!

                Ko Tao is the best island in Thailand. Defo make space for it. 

My Thailand itinerary last April was a bit stupid though, far too much travelling and some places weren't the best. I didn't like Koh Lanta personally, found it deathly quiet without much to do apart from the national park.

Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Krabi, Phuket, Ko Phi Phi, Ko Lanta, Ko Samui, Ko Phangan, Ko Tao, Krabi fly Chiang Mai (purely for price of flights from Ko Samui v. Boat and flight from Krabi).

                    Reply:5
                    Thank you so much! Have heard amazing things about koh Tao so we definitely going there. We will be diving too. I’m going to cut out some places as I now realise it’s too much travelling.

                        Reply:6
                        It's doable, but it's almost doable for doables sake.

Chiang Mai/Pai/Rai is certainly doable in a week or 9 days. 

Bangkok, probably a 2 night jobby - it's not my favourite city if I'm honest. 

Ko Samui/Phangan/Tao are relatively close together and you can spend 9 days or 3 weeks there depending on how much you like it.

Krabi is quite nice, Railay is only 20 mins from Ao Nang and you can have a day trip there without missing much - although the sunset there is stunning.

That seem like a lot of different islands, and an island is an island... From what I know the first route is wacky, like going from Pha Ngan to the "Trat" islands is not ideal, so it's either the Krabi and down there island, or the around Trat ones.

1st: If you do the "Trat" ones you can hop to Cambodia for Angkor Wats (best temple complexe you'll see in Asia or even in the world IMO) and arguably better islands (or what used to be ?) away from Sihanoukville (I loved North Koh Ta Kiev, felt like Thailand before the 00's with bambou huts and no electricity), really liked Koh Rong too, but it was turned into a chinese casino disaster I heard ? I loved Koh Chang but it got very "russian"/build up now, didn't do the smaller ones, heard tales of sandflies and those monsters like me too much to even try...

Alternative route for 1st: start from Chiang Mai, than from Chiang Rai go to Luang Prabang in Laos on a Mekong 2 days "cruise", Luang Prabang (and Laos in general) is amazing, than continue down to Vientiane via Vang Vieng, and from there to the Trat region (make a stop in Angkor "on the way") to end up by the relaxing beaches after all the visiting. (and like that you avoid unnecessary planes rides)

2nd: If you go south, you have to take into consideration that some islands are bigger with stuff to see on it, and other are just island life. Tao have great restaurants and Padi training but not much else (lot of shallow waters beaches). Pha Ngan is part too family friendly/ part too party vibe, and beware of the life ruining sandflies ! On the other side I didn't like Lanta that much (large beaches with no shades lined with restaurants/hotels, some nice "untouched" one to the south but not crazy beautiful), great food tho. I liked Pipi even if very crowded in the day time with tours, my personal favorite was tiny Kradan, the most beautiful paradise type views I had in all around Thailand, but the food is not great (at least for the thai, it's mostly italian) and accommodation is expensive for what you get (used to have cheap bungalows far north but they closed during the pandemic from what I know). And controversial but I didn't care for Krabi...

For the north I really liked going after Pai to the Myanmar border, to Mae Hong Song, but I had a lot of time.

Great site for infos [Travelfish.org](http://Travelfish.org)

Have a great trip !!

    Reply:1
    Wow thank you so much, this is so helpful and has really made me rule out my 1st itinerary as we unfortunately have to start our route in Krabi as spending a week there with family for Christmas until we off on our own. From northern Thailand we actually going to Laos as we travelling in total for 3.5 months. Will look at kraden and thinking of skipping lanta and lipe now then continuing with the 2nd itinerary.

        Reply:2
        Oh that's great ! In Laos I really liked the tiny village of Muang Ngoi Neua, only accessible by boat but with great food and bungalows in lush gardens on the river, the views on the mountains from your hammock are to die for, with tiny wooden villages on rice fields in close distance, I heard they got a road now tho, and probably changed a bit...

If it's your first trip there: be carful with your bags in thai buses, don't let anything of value in your big checked ones and lock them up, they get looked into during the trip pretty often, even - especially - on luxury bus companies, by the "helpers"

But it's just amazing, easy to travel, cheap, people are fantastic (as long as you respect them), beautiful architecture and sceneries, incredible food, you're going to love it so much ! Enjoy !

            Reply:3
            Sounds great and thanks for the advice will definitely be keeping this all in mind. Very excited!

I would pick 2 islands (3 at most) so you can actually enjoy each place you go.  It is exhausting to pack travel, unpack, pack travel, etc.  With only 48 hours or so in each place.


What is it you hope to get our of this trip?  History, relaxation, culture, excitement.  That will determine where to go.  Thailand is an amazing country.


One suggestion if it's your first time in SE Asia:  from Bangkok fly into Siem Reap one morning and see Angkor Wat.  Stay 1 night, see more of the temples and fly back that evening to Bangkok or another location.  

    Reply:1
    Thank you! Yes we are hoping to enjoy the culture, nature, history and have some moments of relaxing. We also enjoy diving. I think you right in terms of cutting the islands down

Initial thoughts: It would be a damn shame to fly into Phuket and not see Krabi and Ko Phi Phi if the weather is decent, especially as it’s low season and not mobbed with tourists. 

Flying into Cambodia to see Phnom Penh and not Angkor Wat is literal insanity. Not that the killing fields aren’t worth visiting if you are in PP, but there’s not exactly a lot to see w/o your imagination, and not really worth going way out of your way to get to.

Burning season is fine, I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you have major respiratory issues, in which case you shouldn't be travelling to SEA anyways. That said, you could consider going to Koh Samui or Koh Tao instead, just to see a different side of the island culture.

    Reply:1
    Thank you for this. When you say different side of island culture, can you elaborate on what you mean please? Would it really feel different to Krabi? (which I appreciate is technically mainland not island)

        Reply:2
        I don't think it would feel super different, but it depends on what/where you book. It's just another place to see, it wouldn't necessarily be a drastic difference. Krabi itself is very textured and has everything from partying, to national parks, to isolated resort life, so you need to choose your own adventure here. The Koh Samui - Koh Tao chain of islands is similar, there's a lot of choice in what your experience could be. Partying, diving, quiet resorts, nature, etc. 

If you want a drastic difference, you might want to consider Malaysia, it seems to be a very common option for people making their way to Krabi — I haven't done Malaysia though, personally.

I’m doing the same thing in January, and also debating what to do in the middle, I’m considering Hanoi or Ho Chi Min as both are short and accessible flights from Bangkok.

If you're in Krabi, go to Raleigh and Tonsai.

        They can, but we stayed in Tonsai for like 4 days after planning on it being only 1 night and enjoyed it as a chill out spot in the middle of our trip. It's a lot slower and feels like you're on an island.

I went to Chiang Mai in April this year. I’d read about burning season but when I was there I didn’t notice anything. It’s a great city, probably my favourite place I visited in Thailand.

        So it was definitely hot. We were there for Songkran but honestly, you stay hydrated, pop into temples, restaurants etc and it’s fine. I would 100% go back to Thailand in April. It was a little quieter.

            Reply:3
            Interesting, thanks for that perspective.. And any issues in terms of visibility from mountains and nature etc?

                No issues from what I remember. We went to an Elephant Sanctuary and took a van to Chiang Rai but I didn’t spot anything too bad. It’s also possible we got lucky.

Comment:
I had the same thing last March, idea was to go Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket (as was meeting friends who were flying in from Oz and UK).

Instead I went to Krabi after Bangkok and then went to Chiang Mai a few months later in May. 

If you can do it, I would prefer Vietnam over Cambodia in every way however for 4 days, it might be good to pop over to Siem Reap and see Angkor Wat.

    Reply:1
    Considered Siem Reap, but also hearing how March is too hot for it so not sure!

  
Where in Vietnam would you recommend?

        Reply:2
        Vietnam's my favourite country in the world, so it's pretty much an open book. I think North Vietnam is the most spectacular scenery I've seen, particularly Sapa and Ha Giang. Hanoi is a fantastic city as well. The issue is it's 6 hours drive from Hanoi to Sapa, so if you have 4 days then it's probably not going to be worth the visit.

SEA is hot generally in March, and Cambodia rarely gets cold in that time of year, but for 4 days I think it's worth doing that visit, as it is a stunning place - and I'm not generally a fan of Cambodia.

            Reply:3
            Thanks. Have you also done da nang with hue and Hoi an? How does that compare with Hanoi?

                Reply:4
                Hoi an is a lovely town, with a beautiful river and is quite a relaxing place compared to Hanoi. The old town is very easily one of the more chilled out spots I've seen in Vietnam.

Da Nang I only spent an evening in because I was flying out the next day. Went to Asia Asia park at night and was one of about 10 people in a theme park. Felt like a Scooby Doo character. 

Hue I'd love to actually properly visit, but apart from telling you I bought a coffee in between buses which was very nice, I can't say much other than what I've seen on TV.

We absolutely loved Chiang Rai--so much to see and do and there were far fewer tourists there.

    Reply:1
    How many days can you fill up with Chiang Rai? Also wondering if it may still have burning season issues possibly

-----------------------------
Comment:
5 days is too little for Phuket, Ko Phi Phi and Bangkok. Just skip Phuket. Even if you have extra days it would be better to stay in Krabi province which is much closer to Ko Phi Phi than Phuket and where you can make day trips to truly beautiful beaches and islands like Railay beach, Ko Hong and Ko Poda.

For a Brazilian person, Phuket’s beaches aren’t much to write back home.

    Reply:1
    Seconding the recommendation for Krabi. I did Krabi first, Phuket second, and kept thinking about how much better Krabi was. Nicer food, better sights, cheaper prices...

    Reply:1
    Thank you for the info. Is it worth it doing Krabi first and then Bangkok or it doesn’t matter?

        Reply:2
        they are totally different places so it doesn’t really matter. But given that you are probably flying back home from Bangkok I guess it makes more sense to leave Bangkok for last.

BKK to BNE runs nonstop Tuesday Thursday and Saturday during those months. Right there on Google flights. But clicking on the flight into Jetstar's website throws an error.

I'd try to call and see if they can see the flights and ask them to book you on it no charge cause their website is messed up. The travel agencies like Kiwi and Trip show it bookable too. I'm not saying do that, but I'm just providing evidence. Book with Jetstar.

I have not been to Thailand, but spent 5 full days in Singapore and not even that was sufficient to see everything. It's an amazing city.

My wife and I are planning a trip to Southeast Asia for 3 months. This trip will be our first time backpacking and our first time getting travel insurance. I am trying to figure out what I should input for the cost of the trip. I understand that only non-refundable expenses apply, and this is where I need clarification. Our only non-refundable expense is our round-trip flight from the US to Hong Kong. After that, we are just going with the flow. We plan to visit Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, but we don't have anything else booked and probably will not book anything until a few days before we do it.

 

I'm not super concerned with filing a claim to get reimbursed for our travel or accommodations on the trip, but I do want medical and emergency transportation. For instance, if our flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed for some reason, we'd make the most of it and enjoy another day in Phuket.

 

So is it possible to get only the medical portion of travel insurance, and if not, what should I put down for "the cost of the trip"?

Get the travel medical insurance for the whole 3 months. You should use a travel credit card with travel insurance to cover the individual segments during your trip.

    Reply:1
    Can you elaborate on how the credit card travel insurance works?

        Reply:2
        Each travel credit card that offers travel insurance will have a certificate of insurance that explains what is covered, what is excluded and how to make a claim. You'll need the terms and conditions of the Cardholder Agreement and certificate of insurance to understand how travel insurance works for that card. Usually it involves filing a claim online, submitting a lot of documents and waiting weeks to get compensation.

        Reply:2
        An example would be car rental insurance. Because I use my travel card (I have the Venture X but it applies to Amex, chase, etc) I don’t pay for rental insurance from the rental company. I make a claim through my card. The same goes for lost luggage, reimbursement for delays, etc.

But each card is different and has slightly different perks.

            Reply:3
            I've been reading on credit cards forum that the one though your credit card isn't what people think it is.  But that the ones where you pay an annual fee & Venture cards, Amex are better.

I have a CapitalOne Savor that offers it but also only gives 1%.  I was going for BofA Travel card but seems like they don't really cover anything or as much.

                Reply:4
                Yes, you want an actual travel credit card. I’ve used the rental car insurance and it paid for a new windshield no questions asked. You get the annual fee back in perks so don’t let that scare you away.

                    Reply:5
                    Yeah I think my Savor card does that too, but I'm not getting a rental on this trip.  Thanks.

Not worth flying into Jakarta. I'd look at Yogyakarta (for Borobudur and Prambanan) and then maybe Mt Bromo and Ijen on the way to Bali. Bali also has a good volcano climb if Rinjani is not enough (Mt Agung). Don't underestimate it.

Even though it's the tropics these mountains are BIG. It frequently gets below freezing on Mt Bromo so come prepared if trekking is your aim.

    That’s good to know thank you. If you’ve hiked these mountains before, do you think a good pair of trail runners will be enough, or are hiking boots a must?

If your itinerary is set in stone and you definitely want to visit both Ha Long and Ninh Binh then add the extra day to Hanoi. Ha Long Bay takes up 2 days, Ninh Binh is another full day, so with the extra day that gives you at least some time to actually see Hanoi.

If you haven't booked anything yet then I would seriously rethink this whole trip. 2 nights in each place in Thailand isn't even worth it in my experience, all you're gonna do is be travelling the whole time and not get to do anything fun. If the weather isn't on your side then it can basically ruin your whole trip as you have no flexibility. The best thing about travelling in Thailand is just how easy it is to change up your plans and make last minute decisions. I'd ditch Vietnam completely and just go to Bangkok, an island or 2, then Chiang Mai, which will definitely keep you busy for 2 weeks.

    Reply:1
    Only the flight into Bangkok and flight out of Hanoi are set. 

Currently I have 3 nights in Bangkok and CM and 4 in Hanoi, just hopping around islands more. Yeah it might be tight but from how many activities and doing early flights+ferries it might be doable?

        Please stay for a few days. It’s a small island but what a vibe. Find a place close to the chaweng beach. That street is really nice. Would also recommend visiting coco tams one of the evenings for fire show at 7.30 pm. 

I’ve visited Thailand a few times, and, now I just want to simply fly into Koh Samui only. It’s just amazing. 🤩

You could look at going to Koh Lanta from Krabi and staying there for a few days

    Interesting, above poster mentioned Koh Samui. Is there much difference between Koh Samui and Koh Lanta??

Koh Chang is in Trat, so you would need an internal flight from Bangkok. Recommend the Chivapuri if you choose Koh Chang. Other possibilities are Koh Tao or Koh Jum for less touristy places. If you want to go somewhere close to Phuket then Koh Yao Yai or Noi, but they are getting expensive these days. The Vijitt in Phuket is lovely, but the sea goes out for miles at low tide leaving a kind of muddy sludge, that said they have a lovely pool or pool villas

    can’t you drive to the pier to get to koh chang? google maps says about 4 hours to the quay. we would prefer a place with great beaches

        Yes you can take a car from Bangkok but it is quicker to get a Bangkok Air flight to Trat (which is a lovely tiny airport) and get a private transfer to Koh Chang (they drive you on the ferry and to your hotel on Koh Chang, ferry costs extra though). I am assuming you will fly into BKK and Bangkok air flies from there. More info here https://kohchangferries.com/private-transfer-car-minibus/  great beaches depend on what you like. Chivapuri has a good beach, sea may be a bit cloudy in January though. The best beach I ever found in Thailand was on Koh Lipe, but the island is too developed and there is broken glass in the sand on the main beaches. Best hotel there with a beach without glass was Serendipity, but also not cheap

            Ok, we are flying from Sieam Reap, so yes we are flying into Bangkok

Look at Koh Jum. I’ve taken my kids there twice - it’s quiet, calm, pretty, very low-key. Accessible via ferry from Krabi. Or if you want somewhere bigger, stay on the boat to Koh Lanta. Plenty for kids to do but still peaceful. Koh Chang is definitely more touristy. Or if you’re set on Trat, look at Koh Kood / Kut. Beautiful spot, amazing beaches, and smaller / calmer than Koh Chang.

Phuket Marriott Resort & Spa, Merlin Beach

The beach is just okay there--going in the water the corral is harsh on the feet and water was rough at times but the resort pools were great and you can easily take a car into town nearby for dinner, etc.  Not fancy, but decent and affordable.  Many other beaches nearby if you want to check them out too.  A bunch of places around there will advertise "great beaches" but they frankly don't look that great compared to the islands.  For kids to play in the sand and use the pool, it should be good though.

Be aware that going from Cambodia to Phuket can be hard to find direct flights and you often need to go through Bangkok, which makes what should be a short trip, longer than you would expect.

Alternatively, take the train to Hua Hin from Bangkok

Can you squeeze a couple of days in Chiang Mai? The markets/food were incredible, and you’re just surrounded by beauty.

    Unfortunately I think it'll already be difficult seeing 3 place in 10 days!

Always recommend watching a proper Muay Thai match in the official Bangkok stadium if you like a bit of an adrenaline rush.  Watching Asian uncles yelling and gambling was also very entertaining

    Not sure bow how is this relevant to the post?

        My bad thought you might spend some time in Bangkok.  Just something I didn’t see too many travellers do
